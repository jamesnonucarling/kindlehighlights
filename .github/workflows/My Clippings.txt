We live our lives looking for evidence that our stories are true. We want them to be right more than we want to be free. More than we want close and intimate relationships. If the story is “I’m not good enough,” then we’ll either try a bunch of things, all the while looking for evidence that the story is true; or we’ll try nothing, assuming it’s true. In either case, the story is confirmed.

Freemium relies on one basic assumption: that attention is cheaper than money. It essentially allows you to pay for content with a cheaper currency — your attention — than cold, hard cash. But this assumption has now been overturned. For an increasingly larger percentage of the online population, attention has become the scarcest good of all. So “free” content has become terribly expensive, if it consumes your attention without delivering tangible value.

Incomplete capturing (i.e. writing down) of your tasks will absolutely become a bottleneck to any ambitious project you want to take on, as decisions and commitments get lost  Trying to complete tasks that haven’t been properly clarified (i.e. formulated in a way that makes them actionable and outcome-oriented) is difficult and frustrating, since it won’t be clear why you’re doing them  The most comprehensive collection of potential tasks is useless if not organized in a way that they can be quickly identified and acted on  Strategic decision making depends on dedicated reflection time, to make sense of all the information being collected  And of course, all of these tasks amount to excessive record-keeping if not actually engaged with and acted on  We

Instead of one giant “emergency savings” fund that is never quite big enough (and so tempting to “borrow from”), you have a series of smaller, more targeted savings accounts designated for specific purposes.

This is where “capturing” open loops is so valuable. It’s not just that you’re freeing up mental capacity by writing things down. You are also creating a pool of diverse tasks that you can draw upon when you’re looking for a next action. The larger this pool, the better, because it provides you more potential options for what to work on, and more strategic combinations of tasks.

The real alternative is to take on the deep, slow, intentional work of personal growth. This work is messy as hell: letting go of our stories, taking responsibility for our lives, giving up our pride and ego and self-righteousness. This work isn’t glamorous, doesn’t give you status points, and never ends.  But it opens up tremendous new capabilities for speaking, listening, and being with each other. As we expand our capacity to feel our bodies, we become more honest, because the body never lies. As we heal our wounds, certain forms of hierarchy naturally fall away, as people realize they don’t have to consent to it. Other forms of status remain as people realize it is not a threat. Brown says, “When we can stand in knowing another person’s power without feeling threatened, that can be powerful in itself…Being able to really see another person’s expertise without being upset by it.”

The mind is divided into parts, like a rider (controlled processes) on an elephant (automatic processes). The rider evolved to serve the elephant. You can see the rider serving the elephant when people are morally dumbfounded. They have strong gut feelings about what is right and wrong, and they struggle to construct post hoc justifications for those feelings. Even when the servant (reasoning) comes back empty-handed, the master (intuition) doesn’t change his judgment.

His simple formulation is that when we want to believe something, we ask ourselves, “Can I believe it?”28 Then (as Kuhn and Perkins found), we search for supporting evidence, and if we find even a single piece of pseudo-evidence, we can stop thinking. We now have permission to believe. We have a justification, in case anyone asks. In contrast, when we don’t want to believe something, we ask ourselves, “Must I believe it?”

Westen found that partisans escaping from handcuffs (by thinking about the final slide, which restored their confidence in their candidate) got a little hit of that dopamine. And if this is true, then it would explain why extreme partisans are so stubborn, closed-minded, and committed to beliefs that often seem bizarre or paranoid. Like rats that cannot stop pressing a button, partisans may be simply unable to stop believing weird things. The partisan brain has been reinforced so many times for performing mental contortions that free it from unwanted beliefs. Extreme partisanship may be literally addictive.

In the same way, each individual reasoner is really good at one thing: finding evidence to support the position he or she already holds, usually for intuitive reasons. We should not expect individuals to produce good, open-minded, truth-seeking reasoning, particularly when self-interest or reputational concerns are in play. But if you put individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system.

Several of the peculiarities of WEIRD culture can be captured in this simple generalization: The WEIRDer you are, the more you see a world full of separate objects, rather than relationships. It has long been reported that Westerners have a more independent and autonomous concept of the self than do East Asians.3 For example, when asked to write twenty statements beginning with the words “I am … ,” Americans are likely to list their own internal psychological characteristics (happy, outgoing, interested in jazz), whereas East Asians are more likely to list their roles and relationships (a son, a husband, an employee of Fujitsu).

cultural psychology—a new discipline that combined the anthropologist’s love of context and variability with the psychologist’s interest in mental processes.8 A dictum of cultural psychology is that “culture and psyche make each other up.”9 In other words, you can’t study the mind while ignoring culture, as psychologists usually do, because minds function only once they’ve been filled out by a particular culture. And you can’t study culture while ignoring psychology, as anthropologists usually do, because social practices and institutions (such as initiation rites, witchcraft, and religion) are to some extent shaped by concepts and desires rooted deep within the human mind, which explains why they often take similar forms on different continents.

The toll that flu takes each year is indeed steep. According to CDC estimates, each year tens of thousands of Americans die due to influenza and its complications. But influenza differs from SARS-COV-2 in some important ways. First, each year a vaccine is developed which allows for some protection against influenza. Influenza also appears to be less contagious than SARS-COV-2. Someone with influenza infects about 1.3 other people on average over the course of their infection. It currently appears that someone with SARS-COV-2 infects about twice that many.

Over the last two and a quarter centuries, this opposition has been driven by several motivators: fear of adverse side effects, objection to government intrusion in the body, conspiracy theories about “Big Pharma,” the financial motivation of those selling “alternative” treatments and of lawyers seeking to sue drug companies, fear of Western or colonial intrusion into communities, rejection of the idea that anyone but a child’s own parents might know what’s best for them, and a sense of community and identity built around parenting choices.

Immune function in the body has two “branches”: the innate and adaptive immune systems. Often both work together to fight an infection. The innate immune system responds generally to invasion and to bacteria, viruses, and parasites and does not need to be pre-exposed to a disease. The adaptive immune system recognizes particular bacteria, viruses, and parasites and generates an active response to their presence.

The adaptive immune system is what is made use of by vaccination. This system recognizes infections that the body has already encountered and mounts a rapid defense against them, preventing illnesses from reestablishing infection once eliminated. The cell types of the adaptive immune system are subdivided into T and B cells. B cells can be activated and have one of two fates. They can become plasma cells: factories that continuously produce antibodies, or they can become memory cells that “remember” a pathogen. When re-exposed to a pathogen, memory B cells can divide into plasma cells and more memory B cells. Vaccines operate by placing in the body immune-generating structures that are not capable of causing disease on their own. These might be fragments of dead viruses or bacteria, a modified form of an organism that is less virulent, or a related organism that cannot infect humans. These create memory B cells, but do not create the disease.

Benjamin Jesty, a farmer, used cowpox to vaccinate his family. In 1774 smallpox was noted near his farm. He used a darning needle, exposed to pus from an infected cow, to scratch his wife and children. Their wounds became inflamed, but all survived. Later, in 1789, his children were inoculated with smallpox but did not display a reaction.3 According to a physician who wrote of the attempt in 1803, “The boldness and novelty of the attempt produced no small alarm in the family, and no small sensation in the neighbourhood.”4 The inflammation of his wife’s arm produced such upset that a neighboring surgeon almost lost his practice when proposing a follow-up experiment to Jesty’s. There was objection to “introducing the bestial disorder to the human frame.” Jesty was credited with resisting the “clamorous reproaches of his neighbors.” Remarkably, this

Jenner shrewdly began an influence campaign. He met with the king, the prince, and finally the queen of the United Kingdom, using their approval to speed adoption among the aristocracy, from whom it spread to their tenants. Jenner made a political decision to ally himself with establishment forces in order to speed the adoption of vaccination.

Gibbs attacked the Vaccination Act of 1853 on several fronts, complaining that it was an intrusion on personal rights, that it was written to benefit the medical trade, that it treated the populous as too stupid to make their own health decisions, that it mandated a practice that was not universally accepted among physicians, and that it had failed in some individual cases.3 The similarity of his pamphlet’s arguments to those made by modern vaccine opponents is striking.

Gibbs and other anti-vaccine activists did not make scientific objections because they had approached the question with an open mind, and through scientific inquiry, they had decided that vaccination was ineffective. They started with a complex network of personal reasons for objecting to vaccination and approached the science as a source of prestige that could be borrowed for their arguments. From this viewpoint no experiment can be well enough designed, no controls adequate, and no evidence convincing.

Before the discovery of vaccination, smallpox was responsible for a little under 10 percent of deaths in London, dropping to less than 5 percent by the 1850s, with the exception of a pandemic in 1870. It is difficult to estimate the number of lives saved by a technology such as smallpox vaccination. Even a few decades before its eradication, 10 to 15 million people were newly infected, and 1.5 to 2 million human beings died annually,10 especially in the developing world. An estimated 300 million people died of smallpox in the twentieth century alone, as if the entire 2019 population of New York City died thirty-five times. In addition to the lives saved, by the elimination of smallpox, there was also an end to the suffering, disfigurement, and blindness of those who would otherwise have been harmed by it. If you lined up all the people who have lived since 1980 because smallpox was eliminated and took one minute to greet each of them, you would spend the next 144 years meeting people who did not die of smallpox.

In April 1955 one of the worst pharmaceutical accidents in modern history began to unfold as it became clear that more than one hundred thousand doses of polio vaccine produced by Cutter and Wyeth Laboratories had been improperly inactivated and so resulted in 250 cases of paralytic polio and 11 deaths.

One well-publicized case was that of Hannah Poling,24 who at nineteen months received vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Hib, MMR, varicella, and polio. Several months later she developed symptoms of a developmental delay and was diagnosed with encephalopathy caused by a mitochondrial-enzyme deficit. The Polings won compensation through the VICP, despite an absence of biological plausibility, or scientific evidence of causation. They held a press conference announcing the legal ruling, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) responded, pointing out that the ruling was not proof of a link between vaccines and autism. Nevertheless, this case has been used by anti-vaccine activists to suggest that a link between vaccinations and autism has been proven in a court of law.

Legal rulings by the VICP do not determine scientific truth; rather, they determine if a case presented meets the standards set out in law. These standards are often flawed and partial. So the ruling that Dorothy Poling was entitled to compensation under the VICP was a ruling that she met the legal requirements set forth in the law to receive compensation; this ruling did not bear on the scientific question.

Although scientists are motivated to publish, the pace of scientific research often rewards patience and getting things right. A single scientific publication might represent several years’ worth of work and may take several rounds of peer review, new experiments, and revision before it is accepted into a reputable journal. Although desiring to only present factual information, a journalist with a deadline to deliver a story before the publication of a newspaper or the airing of television program may simply not have enough time to “get it right” because they interviewed the wrong people, missed important features, or were not able to follow up on sources.

Homeopathy was initially developed by Samuel Hahnemann at the end of the eighteenth century. It involves two ideas: a belief in the “principle of similars”—that a substance that causes symptoms similar to some ailment can cure that ailment—and a belief that this effect is amplified by serial dilution of the substance, often to the point that no molecule of the original substance exists in the preparation.5 After many studies and systematic reviews, scientists have found no evidence that homeopathic treatments work. In addition, the proposed mechanisms of how it might work are totally implausible. Those reporting positive effects from homeopathy are mostly likely experiencing a placebo effect.

We tend to see ourselves as being less affected by cognitive biases than others are. Others’ motivations are unknown and thus subject to scrutiny. However, we can introspect on the nature of our own motivations, regardless of whether that introspection reaches the correct conclusions.44 Unable to peer into others’ minds, we must rely on hypotheses and theories as to their motivations.

Reasoning that “Person X is a scientist, so they’re motivated by big-pharma money” is an example of how this kind of biased reasoning might act in vaccine discussions. The reverse is of course also true. Vaccine advocates engaging in online discussion may presume bad faith, where none exists, on the part of the vaccine hesitant.

Rather than a battleground, social media can be a powerful tool for scientists and public health advocates to reach the vaccine hesitant, so long as advocates are conscious of how they are framing information, not simply trying to overwhelm anti-vaccine activists with information, and telling a positive story about why vaccination is the correct choice for them.

Several hypotheses may partially explain these human behaviors. One is that when people make decisions, they simply do not like to admit that they were wrong. Another is that people tend to double down on investments they view as moral imperatives because they want to see themselves as moral.2 Another is that we value self-consistency and will pursue behavior that allows us to see ourselves as consistent, even if that behavior is not necessarily rational.

People who are initially agnostic toward vaccines, but who are exposed to members in their community who oppose them, may start to express anti-vaccine views to fit in with their community. Being surrounded by those with anti-vaccine views, they may be exposed to more anti-vaccine arguments over time and thus develop a mental model of vaccination that is based largely on arguments against vaccination that they have been exposed to through their group membership.

Many of the major problems with the pharmaceutical industry, and the public-private partnership that produces and tests new drugs, can be fixed. Journal editors have the opportunity to give space to more publications with negative results. Companies either should (or should be required to) make all trial data public, regardless of their results. Companies spend more on the marketing of drugs than they do on research, and some of that research is itself intended to market drugs. These are problems that can be solved through regulation, but in no way mean that vaccines are unsafe, or do not protect against disease.

Moral foundations theory is a theory from social psychology meant to explain the variations in how people respond to moral arguments.1 It posits that moral arguments tend to be based on certain foundations: concerns about care or harm, about fairness, about loyalty, about authority, and about purity. Some research indicates that these concerns respond best to arguments premised on harm or fairness and that conservatives tend also to respond to arguments based on authority, loyalty, and purity.

People we know are more trustworthy than people we don’t know. Statistics are less convincing than stories. Establishment authorities, such as physicians and federal agencies, engender distrust. Chemicals and substances with long and unpronounceable names can be frightening. We fear that putting things that are not natural into our bodies will make us impure. How we view ourselves and how we appear to our peers informs what we view as good parenting.

We can’t hope to change their minds by making fun of them or forcing information down their throats. Doing your own research isn’t a bad thing, so long as you use good sources. Each of these parents prided themselves on questioning the status quo and doing their own independent research. That research led them to anti-vaccine misinformation, but it also led them away from it. Being skeptical and questioning authority are admirable qualities. However, searching out information must be coupled with searching out good information. Helping people learn which sources are reliable will always be better than just presenting them with facts. The anti-vaccine community will often drop support for those who leave it. As good neighbors and friends, we should accept the burden of being a larger part of someone’s social support network when that happens.

action potentials, which are a form of electrical signaling that first evolved in single-celled organisms around a billion years ago. Later multicellular organisms evolved specialized cells called neurons that use electrical action potentials to carry signals rapidly—up to 120 meters per second, or 270 miles per hour—within the organism. The connections between neurons are called synapses. The strength of the synaptic connection dictates how much electrical excitation passes from one neuron to another. By changing the strength of synaptic connections, animals learn.1 Learning confers a huge evolutionary advantage, because the animal can adapt to a range of circumstances. Learning also speeds up the rate of evolution itself.

The Baldwin effect, as it is now known, can be understood by imagining that evolution has a choice between creating an instinctive organism whose every response is fixed in advance and creating an adaptive organism that learns what actions to take. Now suppose, for the purposes of illustration, that the optimal instinctive organism can be coded as a six-digit number, say, 472116, while in the case of the adaptive organism, evolution specifies only 472*** and the organism itself has to fill in the last three digits by learning during its lifetime. Clearly, if evolution has to worry about choosing only the first three digits, its job is much easier; the adaptive organism, in learning the last three digits, is doing in one lifetime what evolution would have taken many generations to do. So, provided the adaptive organisms can survive while learning, it seems that the capability for learning constitutes an evolutionary shortcut. Computational simulations suggest that the Baldwin effect is real.9 The effects of culture only accelerate the process, because an organized civilization protects the individual organism while it is learning and passes on information that the individual would otherwise need to learn for itself.

These sharp boundaries on machine competence mean that when people talk about “machine IQ” increasing rapidly and threatening to exceed human IQ, they are talking nonsense. To the extent that the concept of IQ makes sense when applied to humans, it’s because human abilities tend to be correlated across a wide range of cognitive activities. Trying to assign an IQ to machines is like trying to get four-legged animals to compete in a human decathlon.

Hassan says that groups toward the destructive end use three kinds of deception: omission of what you need to know, distortion to make whatever they’re saying more acceptable, and outright lies. One of the major differences between so-called ethical cults (Hassan references sports and music fans) and noxious ones is that an ethical group will be up-front about what they believe in, what they want from you, and what they expect from your membership.

The term started gaining its darker reputation toward the start of the Fourth Great Awakening. That’s when the emergence of so many nonconformist spiritual groups spooked old-school conservatives and Christians. “Cults” soon became associated with charlatans, quacks, and heretical kooks. But they still weren’t considered much of a societal threat or criminal priority . . . not until the Manson Family murders of 1969, followed by the Jonestown massacre of 1978 (which we’ll investigate in part 2). After that, the word “cult” became a symbol of fear.

Cultish leaders all rely on the power of confirmation bias by presenting a one-sided version of information that supports their ideology and that their followers actively want to hear; after that, confirmation bias does the work for them. Enhanced by peer pressure, it becomes all the harder to resist. Confirmation bias also explains why cultish leaders’ rhetoric is so vague—the loaded language and euphemisms are made purposefully amorphous to mask off-putting specifics about their ideology (and to leave space for that ideology to change). Meanwhile, followers project whatever they want onto the language.

Then we have System 2, which involves slower, more deliberative, rational judgment. This is a much newer development. In the “information age,” where billions of people interact with each other anonymously online, spreading questionable claims and deleterious conspiracy theories, System 2 thinking becomes useful, because when something sounds fishy, we don’t have to lean on instinct to make decisions about it. We can take our time, ask questions, thoroughly investigate, and then decide how we want to react. Unfortunately, because this process is so much newer than System 1, it doesn’t always work. In part, we have those deeply embedded human-reasoning flaws, like confirmation bias and hazy cognitive labor divisions, to thank for our System 2 dysfunction.

Ghafari points out that when an online guru uses too much “absolutist language,” that’s New Age scammer red flag number one. “Anyone who talks about the concept of feeling our past, our inner trauma, in a universal, oversimplified way,” she clarifies. “For example, statements like, ‘All of us are traumatized as kids, which is why we need to x, y, z,’ or, ‘All of us are from the cosmos and we’re just floating in a quantum field, blah blah blah.’” If simple quantifiers and qualifiers are absent from a guru’s messaging, that’s a sign they are likely unqualified to speak as a mental health authority, and are less interested in actually helping people than they are in convincing as many followers as possible to invest in their prophetic gifts.

They don’t want to sell you pills. They want to sell you a key to enlightenment they don’t actually possess.

It’s exactly this paranoiac rejection of “mainstream” healthcare and leadership that gave such momentum to QAnon, whose rhetoric overlaps considerably with that of the “alternative wellness” sphere: “great awakening,” “ascension,” “5G.” The diagram of QAnon and New Agers looks more circular every day. It appeared an unlikely crossover, at first: that of violent right-wing conspiracy theorists and seemingly progressive hippie types.

In the early 2010s, well before QAnon, the term “conspirituality” (a portmanteau of “conspiracy” and “spirituality”) was introduced to describe this rapidly growing politico-spiritual movement defined by two core principles: “the first traditional to conspiracy theory, the second rooted in the New Age: 1) a secret group covertly controls, or is trying to control, the political and social order, and 2) humanity is undergoing a ‘paradigm shift’ in consciousness” (this definition comes from a 2011 paper from the Journal of Contemporary Religion).

In a sense, we can’t even claim to be growing “less religious” when social media’s job is explicitly to generate ideological sects, to pack people’s feeds with suggested content that only exaggerates what they already believe. As each of us posts, curating our individual online identities, the apps capture those personas via metadata and reinforce them through irresistible targeted ads and custom feeds. No “cult leader” takes advantage of our psychological drives quite like The Algorithm, which thrives on sending us down rabbit holes, so we never even come across rhetoric we don’t agree with unless we actively search for it.

The race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was a feeding frenzy for highly partisan news, with each side eager to demonize the other. But an even more troubling trend was a number of obviously false news sites that were pumping out increasingly outlandish stories about the two candidates. Throughout the United States, and in countries as far flung as Macedonia, enterprising young people realized they could make money feeding Americans exactly the type of content they were craving. Suddenly, stories claiming that Hillary Clinton was secretly in a coma, or that Bill Clinton had fathered a child out of wedlock, were running rampant across Facebook. The people behind them were largely apolitical, but they knew that the more outlandish the story, the more likely it was that a user would click on the link.

Facebook was designed to throw gas on the fire of any speech that invoked an emotion, even if it was hateful speech—its algorithms favored sensationalism.

Facebook’s repeated data privacy violations were symptomatic of a bigger problem. Even a record penalty by the FTC wouldn’t deter the company’s dangerous business practices. With 2.3 billion users and a market valuation of $540 billion, it had become too big to be restrained by regulations alone.

But Pelosi was not intoxicated. She doesn’t drink alcohol. In the original broadcast of the event on the public cable channel C-SPAN, Pelosi was lucid and spoke at an even pace. The video circulating on Facebook and other social media had been manipulated: the original footage had been doctored through simple audio editing techniques that slowed down Pelosi’s speech to around 75 percent of normal speed. It was a frighteningly cheap and easy tweak that opened a new front in the tech industry’s battle against political misinformation.

Our current policies on fact checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for. We strongly object to this policy as it stands.

But by the end of the month, the old algorithm was slowly transitioned back into place. Guy Rosen, Facebook’s head of integrity, confirmed that the changes were always meant to be temporary, an emergency measure taken in the midst of a critical election. Quietly, executives worried how conservatives would respond if a number of prominent right-wing outlets were permanently demoted. There was also concern that Facebook’s changes had led to a decrease in sessions; users were spending less time on the platform. For the past year, the company’s data scientists had been quietly running experiments that tested how Facebook users responded when shown content that fell into one of two categories: good for the world or bad for the world. The experiments, which were posted on Facebook under the subject line “P (Bad for the world),” had reduced the visibility of posts that people considered “bad for the world.” But while they had successfully demoted them in the News Feed, therefore prompting users to see more posts that were “good for the world” when they logged into Facebook, the data scientists found that users opened Facebook far less after the changes were made.

One of the most important things to say about the gender data gap is that it is not generally malicious, or even deliberate. Quite the opposite. It is simply the product of a way of thinking that has been around for millennia and is therefore a kind of not thinking. A double not thinking, even: men go without saying, and women don’t get said at all. Because when we say human, on the whole, we mean man. This is not a new observation. Simone de Beauvoir made it most famously when in 1949 she wrote, ‘humanity is male and man defines woman not in herself, but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being. […] He is the Subject, he is the Absolute – she is the Other.’

failing to include the perspective of women is a huge driver of an unintended male bias that attempts (often in good faith) to pass itself off as ‘gender neutral’. This is what de Beauvoir meant when she said that men confuse their own point of view with the absolute truth.

When I pointed out that this was true for him too (he identified as a libertarian) he demurred. No. That was just objective, common sense – de Beauvoir’s ‘absolute truth’.

These white men also have in common that they are white men. And I labour this point because it is exactly their whiteness and maleness that caused them to seriously vocalise the logical absurdity that identities exist only for those who happen not to be white or male. When you have been so used, as a white man, to white and male going without saying, it’s understandable that you might forget that white and male is an identity too.

Pierre Bourdieu wrote in 1977 that ‘what is essential goes without saying because it comes without saying: the tradition is silent, not least about itself as a tradition’.91 Whiteness and maleness are silent precisely because they do not need to be vocalised. Whiteness and maleness are implicit. They are unquestioned. They are the default. And this reality is inescapable for anyone whose identity does not go without saying, for anyone whose needs and perspective are routinely forgotten. For anyone who is used to jarring up against a world that has not been designed around them and their needs.

The way whiteness and maleness go without saying brings me back to my bad date (OK, dates), because it is intrinsically linked to the misguided belief in the objectivity, the rationality, the, as Catherine Mackinnon has it, ‘point-of-viewlessness’ of the white, male perspective. Because this perspective is not articulated as white and male (because it doesn’t need to be), because it is the norm, it is presumed not to be subjective. It is presumed to be objective.

Cultic abuse can infiltrate groups of all kinds—religious, educational, political, commercial, self-help, or cultural—creating what I call “everyday cults.” Such groups possess coercive traits that are hidden, whether intentionally or not. Such groups often appear harmless, maybe just a little wacky or obsessed about a particular ideology or leader.

According to the late psychiatrist, M. Scott Peck, group participation can be dangerous. He wrote, “Most people would rather be followers. ...there is a profound tendency for the average individual to emotionally regress as soon as he becomes a group member.” 5 Regress? Yes, he claimed, like children looking for their parents. Was our intelligence and capacity for discernment being systematically dialed back by biological and tribal instincts?

Doug provided his version of therapy, but he was not licensed, not bound to any “bothersome” standards. Doug was free to interact with his clients however he wanted. My partnership with Marie guaranteed five or more paid sessions for him each month, but I didn’t see Doug’s game at the time. Unaware of the deal, the cards were stacked against us.

We will learn there is no separation between our inner work and the mentoring program. Everything is fuel for our capacity to scour the depths of our souls, to root out pathology, and to prevent it from polluting the sacred container of the work.”

I feel the power of mentoring: it’s a loving process, sitting with allies in the work, excavating our psyches before a witness. It’s thrilling—we chase the pathology dragon, grab it by its tail, and slap it down. Ha! There you are! It’s vulnerable—we open our hearts to each other as we search for the inner demons that seek to undermine our growth. We are pathology hunters, bringing all evidence of our malaise back to our leader for further insight, grateful to Doug for being what we playfully call “our bullshit police.”

Thank you, Doug, for helping me to see how this dream reveals my sneaky, hiding pathology and how it is contaminating the work. I see how, in my mentoring sessions with all my mentees, I sneak around, try to be perfect, try to ask the right questions, desperately needing them to affirm me—because I do not have the connection with the man in order to live in my own skin. I see it. I am determined to keep seeing it and outing it until He purges this sickness from me. Although it pains me to see this disgusting insincerity, it’s also freeing to ‘out’ it—I get what Doug means by ‘outing the pathology’ in a new way today. Outing means saying to the demon ‘I see you and I see how you have tricked me, how you are holding me hostage.’ And now I wait for His presence in my life to heal me. ‘Please, Animus. Heal me.’

The totalist confession is one of the “eight deadly sins” that he identified through his research and experience with Korean prisoners of war and citizens of communist China in the 1950s. Up in that lean-to, on the first day of my strangling, I submitted to Doug’s artificially induced determination that I was possessed with a die-hard pathology that made me behave and speak like an idiot. I confessed to this sin hundreds of times thereafter, as I described my cure of strangulation, each time believing it a little more. After this experience, the only way I knew for sure if my words and decisions were “coming from the right place” was through Doug’s affirmation. My psyche was torn in two—a functioning, thoughtful, striving person who was a mother, wife, and business owner on the one hand; on the other, a dissociated woman bound by mind control, living in survival mode. At each retreat following my strangling, there was a particular smile on Doug’s face when he talked about this intervention. That smile would later haunt me. He’d tilt his head slightly, one side of his mouth curled up, the other lowered in friendly amusement. Back then, I believed it was the look of a man who loved me unconditionally and

women are dealing on a daily basis with behaviours from men that make – and are often calculated to make – them feel uncomfortable. Ranging from catcalling, to being leered at, to the use of ‘sexualised slurs [and] requests for someone’s name’, none of these behaviours is criminal exactly, but they all add up to a feeling of sexual menace.44 A feeling of being watched. Of being in danger – and in fact these behaviours can easily escalate. Enough women have experienced the sharp shift from ‘Smile, love, it might never happen,’ to ‘Fuck you bitch why are you ignoring me?’ to being followed home and assaulted, to know that an ‘innocent’ comment from a male stranger can be anything but.

As a devoted Moonie, I did my best to fight the deprogramming process. But the information gradually began to sink in. In the days that followed, I came to understand brainwashing as practiced by Mao Tse Tung in his Communist re-education centers. Robert Jay Lifton’s Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism (Norton, 1961) helped me realize that the techniques we used in the Moonies were much like those used by the Chinese Communists to make their people obedient. Eventually, after five days, I came to the painful realization that not only had I been subjected to these techniques, I had used them on others. I was horrified that I could have turned my back on my family, friends, religion, my life goals to essentially become a tool of a demagogue who wants to take over the world.

Real love is stronger than conditional love. The love of family and friends is much more reliable than any relationship based on mind control. Relationships in cults tend to be conditional, based on obedience and subservience. However, once the member passes the honeymoon phase and their servitude becomes evident even to themselves, friends and family have the potential for an ever-increasing positive influence. Time is on their side because destructive influence is never 100 percent. The human spirit needs to be free, and ultimately, cults do not deliver what they promise.

In essence, a destructive cult is an authoritarian group headed by a person or group of people with near-complete control. Charismatic cult leaders often claim divine or otherworldly powers. Many legitimate religions have had powerful figures who inspire enormous dedication. Being a powerful leader is not inherently wrong, though it carries the potential for abuse. A group becomes destructive when its leader actively uses such power to deceive members and to rob them of their individuality

Cult influence is designed to disrupt a person’s authentic identity and replace it with a new identity. By immersing people in a tightly controlled, high-pressure social environment, destructive cults gain control of members’ behavior, thoughts, and emotions. They limit their access to outside information. They literally take control of their minds.

When people who think of themselves as reasonably humane are in a situation where they hurt innocent people, they reduce the resulting dissonance by marginalizing or despising their victims.  There is a strong inclination to reduce cognitive dissonance by rationalization.  In 1956, Festinger wrote When Prophecy Fails, a book about a Wisconsin flying saucer cult. The leader, Marian Keech, said she was receiving messages sent by a superior Guardian from the planet Clarion. She predicted that there would be a great flood and all except a chosen few would perish. Her followers sold their homes, gave away their money, and waited for the spaceships. When the fateful morning came–with no saucers and no flood–one might think the followers would become disillusioned. But Marian Keech proclaimed that the Guardian had witnessed their faithful vigil and decided to spare the Earth. Most members wound up feeling more committed to her, in spite of the public humiliation. According to Festinger, the reason for this renewed commitment is that the cult members’ feelings and thoughts had to be changed to reduce the dissonance created by events. Cognitive dissonance theory simplified a highly complex phenomenon. Neuroscientists have since developed more

When a loved one enters a cult, the entire family system is impacted. Parents are often consumed with guilt, fear, anger, and frustration. Long-term successful marriages can buckle. Siblings who had very good relationships may feel annoyed when pressured by their loved one to join the cult, and angry or upset when they are labeled evil for refusing. At the very least, siblings feel frustration and anger as they see the pain the cult member is causing their family. If there were pre-existing problems, such as jealousy, mistrust, control issues, lack of communication or intimacy, a real quagmire can result.

An alternative strategy is to ask the leader or sub-leader to meet you at a restaurant for lunch. This will build trust, and it’s a good way to gather information. Understand that they, too, have an agenda—to check you out and possibly recruit you. If family members say, “At first, we overreacted,” or “We were influenced by the media,” they will be perceived as non-threatening. Spend time getting to know cult members who are close to your loved one. The more you learn, the more tools you will have at your disposal.

After every interaction, try to assess where you are in the process and have an idea of the next several steps that need to be taken to assist the cult member. When planning future interactions, each Team member should ask himself: “Will this step bring me closer to the goal, or take me further away?” Only say and do those things that enhance your relationship and assist the cult member to act independently.

Important Ideas about Reality 1.      Every individual has his own sense of reality and is connected to a shared reality with others. 2.      Our perception of reality is influenced by our inborn characteristics and abilities, psychological development, emotional states, and belief systems. 3.      Our view of reality is influenced (positively and negatively) by memories, beliefs, needs, and social influence. 4.      We all filter and edit the information detected by our senses–we emphasize some things and eliminate others. Otherwise, we would be overwhelmed by information. In fact, a considerable amount of brain function is devoted to inhibiting incoming information. 5.      We can never be 100% certain that our picture of reality is objectively correct. 6.      We never fully know another person's reality. 7.      We are not capable of fully communicating all the things that make up our sense of reality. 8.      We can't assume that what we believe is more than a constructed view of reality. 9.      Our internal monologue interprets, and sometimes distorts, our sense of reality. 10.  We can control some of our inner and outer reality. Total control is impossible although, through discipline (meditation or hypnosis), the mind can develop greater degrees of control. 11.  We can't control all of our reality all of the time. 12.  No matter how much we improve and work to enhance our sense of what is real, it is always incomplete, imperfect, out of focus, and distorted. 13.  The more distorted our sense of reality, the more certain we will be that what we believe is accurate. 14.  The more insistent a person is about the accuracy of his or her observations, the more likely it is that his or her sense of reality is distorted.

A person who is being controlled by a therapist or is in a therapy cult wants to be healed. He might be indoctrinated to believe he has to keep re-experiencing his traumas until they are discharged like electricity from a battery. Tell him, That’s only one of several methods that can be used to deal with traumas. Are you open to learning a faster, easier technique, one that promotes choice as well as healing? For example, some of the techniques mentioned in the phobia chapter can heal trauma faster and with less pain.

Half the global population has to deal on a daily basis with the sexualised menace that is visited on that body. The entire global population needs the care that, currently, is mainly carried out, unpaid, by women. These are not niche concerns, and if public spaces are truly to be for everyone, we have to start accounting for the lives of the other half of the world. And, as we’ve seen, this isn’t just a matter of justice: it’s also a matter of simple economics.

US men manage to find over an hour more spare time per day to rest than their female counterparts,19 while in the UK, the Office for National Statistics found that men enjoy five hours more leisure time per week than women.20 And an Australian study found that what little leisure time women do have is ‘more fractured and combined with other tasks’ than men’s.

There’s a sense of sovereignty that comes from life on a mountain, a perception of privacy and isolation, even of dominion. In that vast space you can sail unaccompanied for hours, afloat on pine and brush and rock. It’s a tranquility born of sheer immensity; it calms with its very magnitude, which renders the merely human of no consequence. Gene was formed by this alpine hypnosis, this hushing of human drama.

Me, I never blamed anyone for the accident, least of all Tyler. It was just one of those things. A decade later my understanding would shift, part of my heavy swing into adulthood, and after that the accident would always make me think of the Apache women, and of all the decisions that go into making a life—the choices people make, together and on their own, that combine to produce any single event. Grains of sand, incalculable, pressing into sediment, then rock.

“People want a miracle,” she’d told me. “They’ll swallow anything if it brings them hope, if it lets them believe they’re getting better. But there’s no such thing as magic. Nutrition, exercise and a careful study of herbal properties, that’s all there is. But when they’re suffering, people can’t accept that.” Now Mother said that healing was spiritual and limitless.

These ideas were familiar to me, but it took me a moment to remember where I’d heard them: in a lecture Dr. Kerry had given on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The Protocols, published in 1903, purported to be a record of a secret meeting of powerful Jews planning world domination. The document was discredited as a fabrication but still it spread, fueling anti-Semitism in the decades before World War II. Adolf Hitler had written about the Protocols in Mein Kampf, claiming they were authentic, that they revealed the true nature of the Jewish people.

I thought of something Tyler’s wife, Stefanie, had told me over the phone a few days before. She said it had taken her years to convince Tyler to let her immunize their children, because some part of him still believed vaccines are a conspiracy by the Medical Establishment. Remembering that now, with Dad’s voice still ringing in my ears, I sneered at my brother. He’s a scientist! I wrote. How can he not see beyond their paranoia! I reread what I had written, and as I did so my scorn gave way to a sense of irony. Then again, I wrote. Perhaps I could mock Tyler with more credibility if I had not remembered, as I did just now, that to this day I have never been immunized.

I was assigned to a sprightly middle-aged woman with tight curls and sharp eyes, who rarely spoke in our sessions, preferring to let me talk it out, which I did, week after week, month after month. The counseling did nothing at first—I can’t think of a single session I would describe as “helpful”—but their collective power over time was undeniable. I didn’t understand it then, and I don’t understand it now, but there was something nourishing in setting aside that time each week, in the act of admitting that I needed something I could not provide for myself.

If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees. When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t making any progress—that makes the jump today possible.

The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. I’ve slipped into this trap so many times I’ve lost count. For years, happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax. Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.

Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity. ■ “I’m terrible with directions.” ■ “I’m not a morning person.” ■ “I’m bad at remembering people’s names.” ■ “I’m always late.” ■ “I’m not good with technology.” ■ “I’m horrible at math.” … and a thousand other variations. When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs.4 You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself.

■ There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change. ■ The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become. ■ Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. ■ Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. ■ The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about

If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.

Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.

In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacle—that is, the more difficult the habit—the more friction there is between you and your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it.

These tricks are unlikely to curb a true addiction, but for many of us, a little bit of friction can be the difference between sticking with a good habit or sliding into a bad one. Imagine the cumulative impact of making dozens of these changes and living in an environment designed to make the good behaviors easier and the bad behaviors harder.

Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments.4 The moment you decide between ordering takeout or cooking dinner. The moment you choose between driving your car or riding your bike. The moment you decide between starting your homework or grabbing the video game controller. These choices are a fork in the road. Decisive moments set the options available to your future self.

With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good. The French economist Frédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he wrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa ….18 Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”

Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.

The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior. Habit stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.

You want to make avoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you want—maybe “Leather Jacket.” Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer $5. Pass on another month of Netflix? Move $10 over. It’s like creating a loyalty program for yourself.

Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.

Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going on each day. One glance at the paper clips in the container and you immediately know how much work you have (or haven’t) been putting in. When the evidence is right in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to yourself.

The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts). Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.

In the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless because they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one coin won’t make you rich, one positive change like meditating for one minute or reading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable difference. Gradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of one another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like adding a grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working for you rather than against you.

I also know that many white men accomplish great things.

At the end of his life, the great picture book author and illustrator Maurice Sendak said on the NPR show Fresh Air, “I cry a lot because I miss people. I cry a lot because they die, and I can’t stop them. They leave me, and I love them more.” He said, “I’m finding out as I’m aging that I’m in love with the world.” It has taken me all my life up to now to fall in love with the world, but I’ve started to feel it the last couple of years. To fall in love with the world isn’t to ignore or overlook suffering, both human and otherwise. For me anyway, to fall in love with the world is to look up at the night sky and feel your mind swim before the beauty and the distance of the stars. It is to hold your children while they cry, to watch as the sycamore trees leaf out in June. When my breastbone starts to hurt, and my throat tightens, and tears well in my eyes, I want to look away from feeling. I want to deflect with irony, or anything else that will keep me from feeling directly. We all know how loving ends. But I want to fall in love with the world anyway, to let it crack me open. I want to feel what there is to feel while I am here. Sendak ended that interview with the last words he ever said in public: “Live your life. Live your life. Live your life.”

in about a billion years, the sun will be 10 percent more luminescent than it is now, likely resulting in the runaway evaporation of Earth’s oceans. In about four billion years, Earth’s surface will become so hot that it will melt.

“We two have paddled in the stream, from morning sun till dine / but seas between us broad have roared since Auld Lang Syne.” And I think about the many broad seas that have roared between me and the past—seas of neglect, seas of time, seas of death. I’ll never again speak to many of the people who loved me into this moment, just as you will never speak to many of the people who loved you into your now. So we raise a glass to them—and hope that perhaps somewhere, they are raising a glass to us.

In her strange and beautiful interactive memoir Textbook Amy Krouse Rosenthal, published in 2016, she wrote, “If one is generously contracted 80 years, that amounts to 29,220 days on Earth. Playing that out, how many times then, really, do I get to look at a tree? 12,395? There has to be an exact number. Let’s just say it is 12,395. Absolutely, that is a lot, but it is not infinite, and anything less than infinite seems too measly a number and is not satisfactory.”

And it’s also a statement that we are, that we exist. And it’s a statement that we are here, that a series of astonishing unlikelihoods has made us possible and here possible. We might never know why we are here, but we can still proclaim in hope that we are here. I don’t think such hope is foolish or idealistic or misguided.

Looking up toward the looming mountain ranges in the distance, I was reminded of what nature is always telling me: Humans are not the protagonists of this planet’s story. If there is a main character, it is life itself, which makes of earth and starlight something more than earth and starlight. But in the age of the Anthropocene, humans tend to believe, despite all available evidence, that the world is here for our benefit.

I’ve often wished—especially when I was younger—that my work was better, that it rose to the level of genius, that I could write well enough to make something worth remembering. But I think that way of imagining art might make individuals too important. Maybe in the end art and life are more like the world’s largest ball of paint. You carefully choose your colors, and then you add your layer as best you can. In time, it gets painted over. The ball gets painted again and again until there is no visible remnant of your paint. And eventually, maybe nobody knows about it except for you.

Disconnection is a fearsome state for a social animal to find itself in. It’s a warning that its life is failing and its world has become hostile: where there’s no connection, there’s no protection. Isolation damages us so profoundly it can change who we are. It can force us into a ‘defensive crouch’, writes psychologist Professor John Cacioppo, in which we seek to fend off the threat of further rejection.

We hallucinate our world into being. Writes the neuroscientist Professor David Eagleman, ‘What we call normal perception does not really differ from hallucinations, except that the latter are not anchored by external input.’ This anchoring of our perception into reality is the job of our senses. But our senses are not to be trusted. Ears, eyes, tongues, skin and noses don’t supply sounds, colours, tastes, touches and smells to the brain, but ‘a chattering stream of electrical pulses racing up the thick bundles of data cables we call nerves’. The experiences the brain makes of these pulses are acts of creation.

The actual world is monochrome and silent. Sounds, colours, tastes and smells exist only in the projection in our heads. What’s actually out there are vibrating particles, floating chemical compounds, molecules and colourless light waves of varying lengths. Our perceptions of these phenomena are special effects in a brain-generated movie. And our senses can only detect the tiniest fraction of what’s out there. Our eyes, for instance, are able to pick up less than one ten-trillionth of the available light spectrum.

A psychologically healthy brain excels at making its owner feel heroic. It does this by reordering our experiences, remixing our memories and rationalising our behaviour, using a battery of reality-warping weapons that make us believe we’re more virtuous, more correct in our beliefs and have more hopeful futures in store than others. For psychologist Professor Thomas Gilovich, the evidence is ‘clear and consistent: we are inclined to adopt self-serving beliefs about ourselves, and comforting beliefs about the world’. The most powerful of these weapons is thought to be the moral bias. No matter what we do, and how dishonestly we play, the brain nudges us to conclude we’re ultimately a better person than most.

As we’ve learned, humans value connection and status. In order to earn the resources essential for our survival and reproduction, we seek to bond with our co-players; in order to secure more of those resources we seek rank. But how do we gauge this rank? How do we tell how we’re doing in this game of life? We do it, in part, by assigning values to objects.

Much of the rest of human life is comprised of three varieties of status-striving and three varieties of game: dominance, virtue and success. In dominance games, status is coerced by force or fear. In virtue games, status is awarded to players who are conspicuously dutiful, obedient and moralistic. In success games, status is awarded for the achievement of closely specified outcomes, beyond simply winning, that require skill, talent or knowledge. Mafias and armies are dominance games. Religions and royal institutions are virtue games.

As psychologist Professor Dan McAdams writes, ‘the human expectation that social status can be seized through brute force and intimidation, that the strongest and the biggest and boldest will lord it over the rank and file, is very old, awesomely intuitive and deeply ingrained. Its younger rival – prestige – was never able to dislodge dominance from the human mind.’

When the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the “why” for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any “how.”

Logotherapy, keeping in mind the essential transitoriness of human existence, is not pessimistic but rather activistic. To express this point figuratively we might say: The pessimist resembles a man who observes with fear and sadness that his wall calendar, from which he daily tears a sheet, grows thinner with each passing day. On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him? “No, thank you,” he will think. “Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these are things which cannot inspire envy.”

These two examples describe a set of symptoms which are all around us. We see organizations operating in a complex, uncertain environment. In an attempt to cope with the complexity the organization grows complex as well. It becomes opaque, which creates internal uncertainty to add to the uncertainty outside. Different parts of the organization are concerned with different things and seek to do a good job by optimizing them. The results clash. Faced with uncertainty, people search for more information; faced with complexity, they do more analysis. Meetings proliferate and decisions are delayed. People in the front line become frustrated at the lack of the decisions they need someone to make to let them get on with their job, and people at the top become frustrated at the apparent lack of action, although the level of activity is high. More initiatives are launched, increasing the level of activity. The psychological effect is to increase confusion. There is lots to do, but what will have the greatest effect and who should do it? Accountability becomes more diffuse, so controls proliferate. This slows things down and restricts the scope for front-line decision making.

1 DECIDE WHAT REALLY MATTERS You cannot create perfect plans, so do not attempt to do so. Do not plan beyond the circumstances you can foresee. Instead, use the knowledge which is accessible to you to work out the outcomes you really want the organization to achieve. Formulate your strategy as an intent rather than a plan.

2 GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS Having worked out what matters most now, pass the message on to others and give them responsibility for carrying out their part in the plan. Keep it simple. Don’t tell people what to do and how to do it. Instead, be as clear as you can about your intentions. Say what you want people to achieve and, above all, tell them why. Then ask them to tell you what they are going to do as a result.

If Clausewitz is right, no one should develop a strategy without taking into account the effects of organizational friction. Yet we continue to be surprised and frustrated when it manifests itself. We tend to think everything has gone wrong when in fact everything has gone normally. The existence of friction is why armies need officers and businesses need managers. Anticipating and dealing with it form the core of managerial work. Recognizing that is liberating in itself.

Gathering and processing more information costs money and time. It is driven by a desire for certainty, a quest which can never be satisfied. Time passes and decision making slows down. Providing more detail is a natural response to a demand for clarity. But clarity and detail are not the same thing at all. The pursuit of detail actually increases noise and so makes it less clear what really matters. Details change quickly, so the more details we put in our plans the less robust they will be.

A survey conducted by the University of Michigan in 2005 identifies a range of barriers to execution, first among which is the “past/habits” of the organization.38 In most cases the underlying problem was attributed to “leadership.” The respondents’ view was that the solution was to focus on alignment. The survey’s author questions this, suggesting that although we put a lot of effort into developing and communicating strategy, “what we do not do is anticipate that things will change.”39 She then observes that “great companies excel at realignment.” They listen to employees and customers “and they use that information to craft and recraft their strategies.”

General Meckel wrote that a directive had two parts. The first was a description of the general situation and the commander’s overall intention; the second was the specific task. Meckel stressed the need for clarity: “Experience suggests,” he wrote, “that every order which can be misunderstood will be.”36 The intention should convey absolute clarity of purpose by focusing on the essentials and leaving out everything else. The task should not be specified in too much detail. Above all, the senior commander was not to tell his subordinate how he was to accomplish his task, as he would if were to issue an order. The first part of the directive was to give the subordinate freedom to act within the boundaries set by the overall intention. The intention was binding; the task was not. A German officer’s prime duty was to reason why.

Von Clausewitz summed up what it had all been about in his classic On War. Men could not produce strategy to a formula. Detailed planning necessarily failed, due to the inevitable frictions encountered: chance events, imperfections in execution and the independent will of the opposition. Instead, the human elements were paramount: leadership, morale, and the almost instinctive savvy of the best generals. The Prussian general staff, under the elder von Moltke, perfected these concepts in practice. They did not expect a plan of operations to survive the first contact with the enemy. They set only the broadest of objectives and emphasized seizing unforeseen opportunities as they arose. In current American parlance, the art of the broken-field runner was the key to success. Strategy was not a lengthy action plan. It was the evolution of a central idea through continually changing circumstances.

The name I have chosen for mission command in business is “directed opportunism.” Its essence can be summarized as in Figure 9 overleaf. This solution constitutes a system and enacting it involves going round a loop. It involves abandoning the linear model of developing a strategic plan and then implementing it. Instead, there is a cycle of thinking and doing. The horizon within which actions are planned is limited, the effects of the actions are observed, reflected on, and new action initiated. So the thinking–doing loop becomes a learning–adapting loop. An organization which behaves in this way will be observed to take action rapidly and keep adjusting what it does. So the “plan-and-implement model” of strategy becomes a “do-and-adapt” model. Strategy development and execution merge into one circular process, as in Figure 10. Figure 9 Directed opportunism

They can act faster than their opponents and keep on doing so, because speed is built into them structurally. By the same token, they can exploit unexpected opportunities and recover from setbacks. Mission command creates an organization which is not only more thrusting, but more resilient. If they have a clear understanding of purpose, people understand what matters and can react quickly to whatever is unexpected, be it good or bad. Beyond this, mission command unleashes human energy and acts as a motivator. It demands, creates, and fosters large numbers of leaders and enables them to stretch themselves while working within limits. Directed opportunism can achieve the same thing in business.

Conducting a campaign will involve continuous decision making, seeking not to take perfect decisions, any more than we should seek to create a perfect plan, but ones that are sensible given the circumstances.

So although the aim is constant, the path can change; indeed, it normally should. The existence of the original aim gives coherence to the decisions and provides criteria for subsequent decision making as circumstances change. However, the relationship between strategy and operations, between strategy development and strategy execution, is reciprocal: “strategy builds on every successful engagement to exploit it further.” Strategy is about fighting the right battles, the important ones you are likely to win. Operations are about winning them.

Rather than a plan, a strategy is a framework for decision making. It is an original choice about direction, which enables subsequent choices about action. It prepares the organization to make those choices. Without a strategy, the actions taken by an organization degenerate into arbitrary sets of activity.

Insights into the center of gravity of a business and hence innovative strategies tend to come from people of long experience who have an unusual capacity to reflect on that experience in such a way that they become aware of the patterns it shows. This awareness enables them to understand how all the elements of their experience relate to each other so that they can grasp and articulate the essentials. Because of this, what to others is a mass of confusing facts is to them a set of clear patterns making the answer to many problems obvious. Hence they have the courage to act.

Strategy is essentially an intent rather than a plan, because the knowledge gap means that we cannot plan an outcome but only express the will to achieve it, and the effects gap means that we cannot know for certain what the effects of our actions will be, and that we will probably have to modify our actions to achieve the outcome we want.

A good analysis of the situation will result not simply in a description of things that are going on, but insight into the basis of competition, the center of gravity of the business. Strategy is essentially an intent rather than a plan, because the knowledge gap means that we cannot plan an outcome but only express the will to achieve it, and the effects gap means that we cannot know for certain what the effects of our actions will be, and that we will probably have to modify our actions to achieve the outcome we want. We can only do that if we are clear about what outcome we desire. If we are lucky, we may be able to penetrate the fog of uncertainty around us sufficiently to be able to set a compass heading and a destination. If we are unlucky, we may not be confident about either. Most of the time we will be able to do one or the other to some degree. Whatever the uncertainties, the organization has to have some idea where it is heading and what to do next. In all cases, but particularly in the worst case of high short- and long-term uncertainty, we can exploit the reciprocal nature of strategic thinking to help us. By going round the loop of ends and means, we can define the minimum that strategy needs. Even if we are unsure about the destination, we can specify an end-state; and even if we are unsure about our compass heading, we can specify a next step. Suppose that we are unsure about the destination: We don’t know if it is San Francisco we want to get to. However, we do know that it is a place on the coast, with a harbor and a fertile hinterland. Los Angeles might also fit the bill – we can’t yet say, nor do we have to.

The flaw is a component of the dream we weave around reality. It’s a quirk in our cognition that keeps us in the game and playing. If there’s any consolation in these stories it’s that, paradoxically, it’s something of a leveller. The elites, so far above us, will never find what they’re looking for. No matter who we are or how high on the scoreboard we climb, life is a game that never ends.

For the first time, major wealth began to accumulate in private hands. Most of it floated upwards, to the clan at the top. And how would they explain their rise? By telling a self-serving story which said they deserved to be there: that they were truly special. They’d often forbid intermarriage with lower clans, a move that enabled them to define themselves as a categorically separate, divine class of human.

The ultimate purpose of all status games is control. They were designed by evolution to generate cooperation between humans; to force (in the case of dominance) or bribe (in the case of the prestige games of success and virtue) us to conform.

It’s thought the major religions came about as a way of controlling the unprecedented numbers of people that began living side-by-side in the first ‘megasocieties’. Gossip alone couldn’t manage hundreds of thousands of disparate people, as it had in the hunter-gatherer era, so we invented moralising gods that tempted and punished us into behaving.

Elite cliques are formed by players who are naturally better at making friends. ‘Social mammals are status seeking, that is, interested in befriending powerful, appealing, or popular individuals,’ writes Professor Nicholas Christakis, an expert in social networks. ‘Those desirable partners tend to be connected to other desirable partners because they get to choose who they are friends with. Partly as a result, less popular individuals wind up being friends with less popular individuals.’ It’s this type of sorting that results in our ‘status-based society’.

The integrator is the person who harmoniously integrates the major functions of the business. When those major functions are strong and you have strong people accountable for each, great healthy friction and tension will occur between them. The integrator blends that friction into greater energy for the company as a whole. I use the term “integrator” to cut through all the wonderful titles for this role, such as CEO, president, general manager, king, or queen. It doesn’t matter what you call it, but the bottom line is that the integrator is the person who has the Unique Ability® to run the organization, manage day-to-day issues that arise, and integrate the three major functions.

At the end of the day, after multiple people have walked into your office with their problems and left them with you, you end up with 20 monkeys jumping around your office. If someone walks in with a monkey, he or she needs to walk out with it. If he or she can’t or won’t, you’ve hired the wrong person.

The unfortunate reality is that most organizations don’t have a Scorecard. They lack activity-based numbers to review on a regular basis. They might rely on a P&L (profit and loss statement) to tell them the score, but by then it’s too late to make corrections. A profit and loss statement is a trailing indicator. Its data comes after the fact, and you can’t change the past. With a Scorecard, however, you can change the future.

Assuming you’re convinced, the following step requires you to convince your people. You have to consider their point of view. If you didn’t see the value in following a process before, how can you expect your people to see the value now? What you need to show is how the new system will create efficiencies to make their lives easier and the company more successful. They need to understand how the processes tie together into a complete system. You shouldn’t expect them to put you on their shoulders and carry you out of the room cheering, but do expect them to follow their assigned processes. While this isn’t quite like announcing a company-wide 25 percent raise, you should present it with the same enthusiasm.

Once you set the company Rocks and then the leadership team’s Rocks, you then communicate these Rocks to the entire organization so they can set theirs. This process creates alignment.

African Americans had been spared the full brunt of the opioid epidemic: doctors were less likely to prescribe opioid painkillers to Black patients, either because they did not trust them to take the drugs responsibly or because they were less likely to feel empathy for these patients and want to treat their pain aggressively. As a result, levels of addiction and death were statistically low among African Americans. It appeared to be a rare instance in which systemic racism could be said to have protected the community.

The idea of Rassenkampf, or ‘race war’, gave the Russian campaign its unprecedented character. Many historians now argue that Nazi propaganda had so effectively dehumanized the Soviet enemy in the eyes of the Wehrmacht that it was morally anaesthetized from the start of the invasion. Perhaps the greatest measure of successful indoctrination was the almost negligible opposition within the Wehrmacht to the mass execution of Jews, which was deliberately confused with the notion of rear-area security measures against partisans. Many officers were affronted by the Wehrmacht’s abandonment of international law on the Ostfront, but only the tiniest minority voiced disgust at the massacres, even when it became clear that they belonged to a programme of racial extermination.

Sometimes when Russian and German recce groups passed each other at night in no man’s land, they pretended not to see each other. Each had specific orders not to be deflected from their task by a firefight. If, however, small groups met head on, then the struggle was often conducted in deadly silence with knives or sharpened bayonets. ‘When I killed a German with a knife for the first time,’ a Russian recce platoon commander from the marine infantry remembered, ‘I saw him in my dreams for three weeks afterwards.’ One of the biggest dangers, however, was returning to your own lines away from where you were expected.

Many people think of loneliness as isolation, but the difference between these two terms is substantial. Loneliness is the subjective feeling that you’re lacking the social connections you need. It can feel like being stranded, abandoned, or cut off from the people with whom you belong-even if you’re surrounded by other people. What’s missing when you’re lonely is the feeling of closeness, trust, and the affection of genuine friends, loved ones, and community.

Psychologist Dr. Bill von Hippel, who wrote The Social Leap,[4] told me that groups became especially valuable to our hominid ancestors about three million years ago, when the body of the Australopithecus adapted in ways that enabled them to throw. “Now they had the most important innovation in military history,” Bill said. “The ability to kill at a distance.” Back then, even if fifty hunters tried to club a lion at close range, the casualty rate would have been high, but throwing enabled them to hurl stones from a position of relative safety. “Once we can kill at a distance, everything changes. Now we all have incentive to work together as a group. We can survive if we coordinate and throw all at once.”

Oxytocin, which means “quick birth” in Greek, is perhaps best known for its role in pregnancy, labor, lactation, and mother-child bonding. It has also been found to promote bonding within your group by reducing fear and stress while making you more defensive against those who are not part of your group. Put another way, it may make strong bonds stronger and weak bonds weaker.[6] Endorphins are naturally occurring opioids that reduce our perception of pain and contribute to a feeling of euphoria and pleasure. Endorphins can be released when we experience pain or when we exercise (as in the “runner’s high”), but they are also released when we physically touch and when we move in synchrony with others. This explains why dancing and love make such excellent partners. Additionally, dopamine, a key player in the brain’s reward systems, is a powerful motivator for connection, surging in response to isolation and driving us to seek companionship.

The more overtly unshakeable someone’s beliefs are, the more diminished they seem to become, because they have stopped questioning, and the not-questioning can sometimes be accompanied by an attitude of moral superiority.

The persistence of irrationality is a puzzle. But the status game suggests an explanation. Humans aren’t heroes on wondrous journeys of progress, we’re players programmed for games. To succeed in these games, we seek high-status allies. When we find them, our copy-flatter-conform circuitry switches on. We mimic not just their behaviour but their beliefs. The better we believe, the higher we rise. And so faith, not truth, is incentivised.

Our brain has various tricks that nudge us into accepting our game’s story of the world and believing what it’s supposed to: it tells us the members of our group are more intelligent than others; it finds it harder to reason logically over arguments that contradict our group’s beliefs; it processes opinions we already agree with as if they’re facts; it often automatically assumes those who hold different beliefs are stupider, more biased, less moral and less trustworthy than we are, making it all too easy to dismiss them. And intelligence is no inoculation. On the contrary. When brilliant people are motivated to find evidence to support their group’s false beliefs, they’re brilliant at finding it. Their superior intelligence simply makes them better at reaffirming their bent story of reality. When psychologists study how people’s religious, political and social identities affect their beliefs, they find that the more educated, numerate and intelligent they are, the more likely they are to endorse the fringe ideas of their groups.

A success game approach to the riddance of secret sex-satanists could be expected to start with a useful assessment of the problem. This would’ve led to the realisation it didn’t exist. The consequence? Not much status for the Satan-hunters. Instead, they played a virtue game. Virtue games often do weave a story around their striving that says they are motivated by the solving of some critical problem – frequently in the form of some evil, high-status enemy – but the truth is betrayed by their mode of play.

The Satan-hunters were simply doing what nature had programmed them to do. Their brains detected a game that offered fantastic rewards: connection with like-minded others and status in the form of influence, acclaim, cash, fame, proximity to the prestigious games of law, media and government and the reputation of an avenging angel, defending the lives of America’s children. And so they played. They believed the dream and they believed it sincerely. Of course they did. They were only human.

If there’s a warning from this, it’s that we should be suspicious of any idea, such as ‘believe children’ or ‘vaccines are harmful’, that allows connection into a game. We should be yet more suspicious when status, in that game, is earned by active belief in it. This is what happened during the Satanic Panic and it’s what Maranda Dynda experienced in the world of the vaccine deniers and it’s what drove the men of Pohnpei to devote their lives to the growing of massive yams. When people accept a core belief and act on it, as the price for earning connection and status, they allow themselves to become possessed. That belief is now a status symbol. As their hallucination of reality bends itself around it, they become its host and crusader, deranged and impossible to reason with. In short, their belief has become sacred.

Beliefs can become sacred too. They frequently do. This is why our reasoning about our sacred beliefs can become so impaired. ‘When a group of people make something sacred,’ writes the psychologist Professor Jonathan Haidt, they ‘lose the ability to think clearly about it.’ Beliefs are like my Mötley Crüe T-shirt, only infinitely more dangerous. Sacred symbols can be seen as physical carriers of our status: when someone attacks them, they attack our game and our co-playing kin; they degrade all that we’ve earned and all that we value. They scorn our dream of reality, our lived experience, and the ways we think and act in it in order to feel superior. This is why beliefs can make us irrational and violent. It’s why they can send us to war.

Our status games are embedded into our perception. We experience reality through them. So when we encounter someone playing a rival game, it can be disturbing.

That perhaps grief can be seen as a kind of exalted state where the person who is grieving is the closest they will ever be to the fundamental essence of things. Because, in grief, you become deeply acquainted with the idea of human mortality. You go to a very dark place and experience the extremities of your own pain – you are taken to the very limits of suffering.

I think to be truly vulnerable is to exist adjacent to collapse or obliteration. In that place we can feel extraordinarily alive and receptive to all sorts of things, creatively and spiritually. It can be perversely a point of advantage, not disadvantage as one might think. It is a nuanced place that feels both dangerous and teeming with potential. It is the place where the big shifts can happen. The more time you spend there, the less worried you become of how you will be perceived or judged, and that is ultimately where the freedom is.

We are all, at some point in our lives, obliterated by loss. If you haven’t been by now, you will be in time – that’s for sure. And, of course, if you have been fortunate enough to have been truly loved, in this world, you will also cause extraordinary pain to others when you leave it. That’s the covenant of life and death, and the terrible beauty of grief.

I knew it would be risky, because I was giving people permission to ask anything they wanted, but my thinking was, ‘What does it really matter what happens?’ So that was a big shift in my thinking, for sure: to relinquish concern for the outcome of my artistic decisions and let the chips fall where they may. That idea has reverberated through everything I have done since.

You feel that we are imperilled? Yes. Insofar as anything can turn catastrophic at any time, personally, for each of us. Look at this pandemic. Look how unbelievably vulnerable we are. All these systems supposedly holding the world in place and we are laid low by a virus. Each life is precarious, and some of us understand it and some don’t. But certainly everyone will understand it in time. And because of that, I feel a kind of empathy with people that I never felt before. It feels urgent and new and fundamental. For the predicament we have all found ourselves in – the predicament of an imperilled life.

And it shatters them completely, into a million pieces, and it seems like there is no coming back. It’s over. But in time they put themselves together piece by piece. And the thing is, when they do that, they often find that they are a different person, a changed, more complete, more realised, more clearly drawn person. I think that’s what it is to live, really – to die in a way and to be reborn. And sometimes it can happen many times over, that complex reordering of ourselves.

since Arthur died I have been able to step beyond the full force of the grief and experience a kind of joy that is entirely new to me. It was as if the experience of grief enlarged my heart in some way. I have experienced periods of happiness more than I have ever felt before, even though it was the most devastating thing ever to happen to me. This is Arthur’s gift to me, one of the many. It is his munificence that’s made me a different person. Susie, too. We’ve never felt more engaged in things. I say all this with huge caution and a million caveats, but I also say it because there are those who think there is no way back from the catastrophic event. That they will never laugh again. But there is, and they will.

So, for you, what is the shared objective? To be awed. To experience a communal sense of awe. I can feel it on stage and see it in people’s eyes. And I experience it too. It’s certainly something I have felt many, many times at other artists’ concerts. It’s about reaching an essential and shared state through music – sometimes for a moment, sometimes for an entire concert. We’ve all experienced that. Not just a physical release, although there is that, too, but to be held by an artist at the crucial moment of expression – to be awed, second by second, at the way a song or piece of music unfolds, to be held on the edge of tears by the drama of it all, and to be, as an audience member, an essential participant in the drama itself. That is a wonderful thing.

You no longer have to devote time to finding out what you are, you are just free to be whatever you want to be, unimpeded by the incessant needs of others.

Susie is my wife, but also a collaborator. She comes from a very musical family. She has an innate and maybe inherited understanding of music – much more nuanced than mine – even though she doesn’t play anything. She also has a highly evolved aesthetic sense that is very much her own. These things work together to make her very sensitive towards certain things – like the way I perform a song, say, or, generally, how I present myself to the world. And

Firstly, I believe, as a general rule, that the vitalising element in art is the one that baffles or challenges our outrages. I believe art should be confronting and discomfiting, and do more than just affirm your point of view. For my generation, that particular idea was bred in the bone. As a young musician, I felt it was my sacred duty to offend.

Maybe that’s what I was trying to say earlier about getting old. I think the old become not just repositories of lived experience, but of the dead, too. I’ve lost my mother this year, as well as a good friend, Hal Willner, and they have joined an ever-expanding company of loved ones who have passed on. I think these absences do something to those of us who remain behind. We are like haunted houses, in a way, and our absences can even transform us so that we feel a quiet but urgent love for those who remain, a tenderness to all of humanity, as well as an earned understanding that our time is finite.

Insofar as the rules that govern our lives no longer apply. I am very familiar with this feeling. It is the compensatory gift at the heart of grief. The usual precepts collapse under the weight of the calamity: the terrible demands that we place upon ourselves; our own internal judging voice; the endless expectations and opinions of others. They suddenly become less important and there is a wonderful freedom in that as well.

All events are determined by the logos, and follow in an unbreakable chain of cause and effect. Stoicism is thus from the outset a deterministic system that appears to leave no room for human free will or moral responsibility. In reality the Stoics were reluctant to accept such an arrangement, and attempted to get around the difficulty by defining free will as a voluntary accommodation to what is in any case inevitable.

According to this theory, man is like a dog tied to a moving wagon. If the dog refuses to run along with the wagon he will be dragged by it, yet the choice remains his: to run or be dragged. In the same way, humans are responsible for their choices and actions, even though these have been anticipated by the logos and form part of its plan. Even actions which appear to be—and indeed are—immoral or unjust advance the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and good. They, too, are governed by the logos.

When Marcus refers, as he does on a number of occasions, to “cause and material” he means the two elements of these compounds—inert substance and animating pneuma—which are united so long as the object itself exists. When the object perishes, the pneuma that animated it is reabsorbed into the logos as a whole.

It may be worthwhile, however, to draw attention to one pattern of thought that is central to the philosophy of the Meditations (as well as to Epictetus), and that has been identified and documented in detail by Pierre Hadot. This is the doctrine of the three “disciplines”: the disciplines of perception, of action and of the will.

The third discipline, the discipline of will, is in a sense the counterpart to the second, the discipline of action. The latter governs our approach to the things in our control, those that we do; the discipline of will governs our attitude to things that are not within our control, those that we have done to us (by others or by nature).

The emphasis on the vanity and worthlessness of earthly concerns is here linked to the more general idea of transience. All things change or pass away, perish and are forgotten. This is the burden of several of the thought exercises that Marcus sets himself: to think of the court of Augustus (8.31), of the age of Vespasian or Trajan (4.32), the great philosophers and thinkers of the past (6.47)—all now dust and ashes.

It seems to me that people who are grieving, especially the recently bereaved, live their lives at the edge of a potentiality, adjacent to death, in a kind of poetic twilight world. I say this not only because I inhabit this world myself at times, but because in The Red Hand Files I am confronted with the same story, time and time again – ‘I feel his presence’ or ‘I sense her all around’. Now, we are repeatedly told that these kinds of ‘feelings’ or intimations are a delusion brought about by our desperate need, or that they are somehow a denial of the finality of death, or, worst of all, they reveal a lack of intellectual integrity. Now, we know that. We fucking get it. But these feelings, indefensible as they may be to rationalists, are real and loving and nourishing, and go some way to being a bridge to normality. They may well be delusions, but these poetic intimations guide us back to the world. In that respect, they are as real and true as anything else, and perhaps the most beautiful and mysterious things imaginable. In my view, we deny or dismiss them at our peril.

the young Nick Cave could afford to hold the world in some form of disdain because he had no idea of what was coming down the line. I can see now that this disdain or contempt for the world was a kind of luxury or indulgence, even a vanity. He had no notion of the preciousness of life – the fragility. He had no idea how difficult, but essential, it is to love the world and to treat the world with mercy. And like I said, he had no idea what was coming down the road. He was entirely innocent of all that.

And I think Susie and I are acutely aware of the precarious nature of not only our lives, but all lives – their rareness, their preciousness – and that it can all disappear in an instant. In the light of that knowledge, we find gratitude to be a simple and essential act. And Arthur showed us that – the necessary and urgent need to love life and one another, despite the casual cruelty of the world. Love, that most crucial, counter-intuitive act of all, is the responsibility of each of us.

Well, let’s just say we all have regrets and most of us know that those regrets, as excruciating as they can be, are the things that help us lead improved lives. Or, rather, there are certain regrets that, as they emerge, can accompany us on the incremental bettering of our lives.

The most entrenched regrets we have are generally around those who are no longer with us, right? Or no longer within our sphere of influence. That’s why they are so painful, because it feels like there is no recourse. Personally, I have found it is worth something to express whatever contrition we may have towards those no longer with us, in prayer and meditation, and in song. I find that very helpful. And, of course, to live our lives in the best way we can, you know, in their name.

I think anyone who says they don’t have any regrets is simply living an unconsidered life. Not only that, but by doing so they are denying themselves the obvious benefits of self-forgiveness. Though, of course, the hardest thing of all is to forgive oneself.

I think one sure path to self-forgiveness is to arrive at a place where you can see that your day-to-day actions are making the world a measurably better place, rather than a worse place – that is pretty simple stuff, available to all – and to arrive at this place with a certain amount of humility.

One of the clear benefits of conversation is that your position on things can become more nimble and pliant. For me, conversation is also an antidote to dualistic thinking, simply because we are knocking up against another person’s points of view. Something more essential happens between people when they converse. Ultimately, we discover that disagreements frequently aren’t life-threatening, they are just differing perspectives, or, more often than that, colliding virtues.

if I look back at my past work from the certainty and conviction of the present, it appears as if it was a series of collapsing ideas that brought me to my current position. And what’s more, the actual point I’m looking back from is no more stable than any of the previous ones – in fact, it’s being shed even as we speak. There’s a slightly sickening, vertiginous feeling in all of this.

Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone—those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the “what” is in constant flux, the “why” has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what’s right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us—a chasm whose depths we cannot see. So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any indignation, either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.

In salvation anxiety, the Church smelled opportunity. The Pope claimed the ability to guarantee someone’s place in heaven, by drawing from the ‘surplus’ good deeds of the saints as currency. He began issuing letters, called indulgences, that would forgive sins and ease a person’s passage in the afterlife. First intended as bribes to persuade men to join the Crusades against the Church’s Muslim rivals, they soon became a way of gathering revenue, not least for the building of conspicuous status symbols such as churches and cathedrals.

Because profit-making companies fail to pay them enough to live, their wages are topped up by welfare credits. This arrangement neglects to consider the overwhelming importance of status. When we force hardworking people to accept handouts, we commit on them an injustice: we steal from them something they’ve earned.

Its success has been boosted by its appropriation of a trick pioneered by the monotheists. The Christians conjured hell, which generated salvation anxiety, then presented their game as the only way to escape it. Similarly, New Left activists threaten hell by radically rewriting the terms by which accusations of bigotry can be made, lowering the bar such that mere whiteness or masculinity are signs of guilt. Having generated salvation anxiety, they present their movement as the sole available remedy. Hell’s threat can only be escaped with conspicuous, zealous and highly correct play.

Perhaps the best mode of protection is to play many games. People who appear brainwashed have invested too much of their identity into a single game. They rely on it wholly for their connection and status, the maintenance of which requires them to be filled up with its dream of reality, no matter how delusional. Not only does this put them at risk of committing harm to others, they risk catastrophic collapse themselves. If the game fails, or they become expelled, their identity – their very self – can disintegrate. No such risk can befall the player with a diversity of identities who plays diverse games.

Many of us could benefit from consciously reducing our moral sphere. How much time do you devote to the judging of other people? How much cheap and tainted status do you grab for yourself by doing so? Reducing our moral sphere means casting our eyes inwards, concerning ourselves mostly with our own behaviour instead of that of others. It means ceasing the casual condemnation of distant players living different dreams which we refuse to understand and are all too easy to belittle and hate.

This mode of thinking trips us into arguing over questions with no answer. Asking whether immigration or neoliberalism or religion are ‘good’ or ‘bad’ is nonsensical. It’s pure status play. Which moral class we assign them depends on which game we happen to be playing. The truth of such complex phenomena is usually that they’re trade-offs: they have an array of positive and negative effects that impact different status games in different ways.

Rather than fighting to make our moral truths classed as materially real and deferred to absolutely, we should foster a trade-off mindset. This means viewing the world not in terms of winners and losers but of groups negotiating trade-offs.

We must fight the bigotry of which both sides are guilty. Immigration isn’t ‘good’ or ‘bad’, it’s a deal that impacts different sets of people in different ways. The route forward is more likely to be found if we muster the wisdom to see through the moral cartoon and understand the world not as populated by dragons and dragon slayers, but by players negotiating trade-offs.

Psychologists argue that it’s possible to earn success-based status by engaging in ‘minor acts of nonconformity that do not violate the group’s basic standards for behaviour but attract attention’. Doing your own thing takes imagination and courage, but as long as you’re being useful, and not breaking sacred rules, you have the potential to rise. Originality also makes it more difficult for rivals to catch you. This should be a relief to those of us who obsess, damagingly, over our failure to be perfect. Often, a better strategy lies in trying to be different.

I believe we can all take consolation in the knowledge that nobody ever gets there, not the superstars, the presidents, the geniuses or the artists we gaze up at in envy and awe. That promised land is a mirage. In our lowest moments, we should remind ourselves of the truth of the dream: that life is not a story, but a game with no end. This means it isn’t a final victory we should seek but simple, humble progress: the never-ending pleasure of moving in the right direction. Nobody wins the status game. They’re not supposed to. The meaning of life is not to win, it’s to play.

That kindness is invincible, provided it’s sincere—not ironic or an act. What can even the most vicious person do if you keep treating him with kindness and gently set him straight—if you get the chance—correcting him cheerfully at the exact moment that he’s trying to do you harm. “No, no, my friend. That isn’t what we’re here for. It isn’t me who’s harmed by that. It’s you.” And show him, gently and without pointing fingers, that it’s so. That bees don’t behave like this—or any other animals with a sense of community. Don’t do it sardonically or meanly, but affectionately—with no hatred in your heart. And not ex cathedra or to impress third parties, but speaking directly. Even if there are other people around.

A given action that stops when it’s supposed to is none the worse for stopping. Nor the person engaged in it either. So too with the succession of actions we call “life.” If it ends when it’s supposed to, it’s none the worse for that. And the person who comes to the end of the line has no cause for complaint. The time and stopping point are set by nature—our own nature, in some cases (death from old age); or nature as a whole, whose parts, shifting and changing, constantly renew the world, and keep it on schedule. Nothing that benefits all things can be ugly or out of place. The end of life is not an evil—it doesn’t disgrace us. (Why should we be ashamed of an involuntary act that injures no one?). It’s a good thing—scheduled by the world, promoting it, promoted by it.

You’ve lived as a citizen in a great city. Five years or a hundred—what’s the difference? The laws make no distinction.

Like the impresario ringing down the curtain on an actor: “But I’ve only gotten through three acts …!” Yes. This will be a drama in three acts, the length fixed by the power that directed your creation, and now directs your dissolution. Neither was yours to determine.

A commodity, as I define it, is a product available from many places. For that reason, it’s prone to purchases based on “price” instead of “value.” If all products are “equal,” then the cheapest one is the most valuable by default. In other words, if a prospect compares your product to another and thinks “these are pretty much the same, I’ll buy the cheaper one,” then they commoditized you. How embarrassing! But really . . . it’s one of the worst experiences a value-driven entrepreneur can have.

Here’s the key takeaway from all this: a business does the same work in both cases (with a commoditized or a Grand Slam Offer). The fulfillment is the same. But if one business uses a Grand Slam Offer and another uses a “commodity” offer, the Grand Slam Offer makes that business appear as if it has a totally different product — and that means a value-driven, versus price-driven, purchase. If you have a “commodity” offer, you will compete on price (having a price-driven purchase versus a value-driven purchase). Your Grand Slam Offer, however, forces a prospect to stop and think differently to assess the value of your differentiated product. Doing this establishes you as your own category, which means it’s too difficult to compare prices, which means you re-calibrate the prospect’s value-meter.

In order to sell anything, you need demand. We are not trying to create demand. We are trying to channel it. That is a very important distinction. If you don’t have a market for your offer, nothing that follows will work. This entire book sits atop the assumption that you have at least a “normal” market, which I define as a market that is growing at the same rate as the marketplace and that has common unmet needs that fall into one of three categories: improved health, increased wealth, or improved relationships

There are three main markets that will always exist: Health, Wealth, and Relationships. The reason that those will always exist is that there is always tremendous pain when you lack them. There is always demand for solutions to these core human pains.

One final point I want to drive home: if you offer a service where a customer must do something in order to achieve the result, or solve the problem you say you solve, they must be invested. The more invested they are, the more likely they are to achieve a positive result. Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as humanly possible. Ideally, this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it stings a little when they buy. That sting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service. Those who pay the most, pay the most attention. And if your customers are more adherent and follow through, and if they achieve better results with your service than your competition, then you are in a very real way providing more value than anyone else. This is how you win.

The dream outcome is the expression of the feelings and experiences the prospect has envisioned in their mind. It’s the gap between their current reality and their dreams. Our goal is to accurately depict that dream back to them, so they feel understood, and explain how our vehicle will get them there.

This is also the reason that the supplement industry ($123B, Grandview Research) is twice the size of the health club industry ($62B, IHRSA). They both accomplish the same perceived objectives — “being healthy,” “losing weight,” “looking good,” “increased energy,” etc. — but one is perceived as more valuable because it has lower “costs.” People are more willing to pay $200 for supplements than they are a $29/mo membership. Taking a pill, or drinking a shake, is so much faster and easier than going to the gym everyday. Hence . . . valued.

The reason this works is we are increasing the prospect’s price-to-value discrepancy by increasing the value delivered instead of cutting the price. We anchor the price we tell them to the core offer. Then with each increasingly valuable bonus, that discrepancy grows wider and wider until it's too big to bear and we snap the rubber band in their mind that is holding their wallet in their pocket.

When selling one on one, you ask for the sale first, before offering the bonuses. If they say yes, then after they have signed up, you let them know the additional bonuses they're going to get. This creates a wow experience and reinforces their decision to buy. On the other hand, if the person does not buy after the first ask, then you present a bonus that matches their perceived obstacle, then ask again. Don’t feel weird about asking again. You simply agree with the prospect, add the bonus, and ask if this consolation was “Fair enough.” People have a hard time rejecting reciprocity, so adding a bonus to accommodate, then another, then another, and people will feel almost obligated to buy from you.

Bonus Bullets That being said, there are a few key things to remember when offering bonuses: 1)     Always offer them (you can use the bulleted bundle we came up with at the end of Section III) 2)     Give them a special name that has a benefit in the title 3)     Tell them: a)      How it relates to their issue b)     What it is c)      How you discovered it, or what you had to do to create it d)     How it will specifically improve their lives or make their experience i)            Faster, easier or less effort/sacrifice (value equation) 4)     Provide some proof (this can be a stat, a past client, or personal experience) to prove that this thing is valuable 5)     Paint a vivid mental image of what their life will be like assuming they have already used it and are experiencing the benefits 6)     Always ascribe a price tag to them and justify it 7)     Tools & checklists are better than additional trainings (as the effort & time are lower with the former, so the value is higher. The value equation still reigns supreme). 8)     They should each address a specific concern/obstacle in the prospects mind about why they can’t or won’t be successful (bonus should prove their belief incorrect) 9)     This can also be what they would logically realize they will need next. You want to solve their next problem before they even encounter it. 10) The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. Psychologically as you continue to add offers, it continues to expand the price to value discrepancy. It also, subconsciously communicates that the core offer must be valuable because if these are the bonuses, the main thing has to be more valuable than the bonuses right? (No, but you can use this psychological bias to make your offer seem wildly compelling).

We want to employ bonuses because they expand the price to value discrepancy and get people to purchase who otherwise wouldn’t. They massively increase the prospects' perception of the value of our offer. So here’s what to do: 1)     Create checklists, tools, swipe files, scripts, templates, and anything else that would take lots of time and effort to create on one’s own, but is easy to use once created. Anything that you can invest in one time that clearly costs time or money to create but can be given away endless times is a perfect fit for a bonus. 2)     Beyond that, make a habit to record every workshop, every webinar, every event, every interview and use them as additional bonuses (as needed to crush a perceived obstacle).  3)     Proactively negotiate group discounts and a referral commission with adjacent businesses that solve needs your customer will have as a result of beginning this process with you. What’s the next natural thing they might want? Go to those businesses, get a deal for them they could never get for themselves (because you are negotiating with the purchasing power of all your customers at once, very powerful). Next Up . . .

You can also stack two conditional guarantees around different (or sequential) outcomes. For example, you’ll make $10,000 by 60 days, $30,000 by 90 days as long as you do things 1, 2, and 3.  This future paces the prospect into an outcome they now believe is far more likely

[Conditional] Outsized Refund Guarantee What the Client Gets: Double or Triple their money back, or a no-strings-attached payment of $X,XXX (or another amount that’s far more than what they paid). My Take: This is for when you sell something with high margins. And this is a guarantee to add with a consumption condition. That means they must do a variety of things to qualify for this guarantee. A world class affiliate marketer Jason Fladlien (who did $27M in a single day) recently used an amazing guarantee for a course he sold. He said “if you buy this course and spend $X on advertising your ecommerce store using the methods herein, and don't make money, I will buy your store from you for $25,000 no questions asked.” He claimed that an additional $3M in sales came from this crazy guarantee on a $2997 course. What’s more, he only gave 10 of these $25,000 refunds out. So the refund generated $2.75M in extra sales. That’s what a crazy guarantee does for you. In general, a very strong guarantee like this will definitely drive more sales. This really serves the purpose when you need a lot of stuff to be done by your prospect, and, assuming those things are done, there’s a low chance of the result not being achieved. Sometimes a guarantee like this can actually get clients better results on top. This guarantee will typically outperform a traditional 30-day money back guarantee in terms of net conversions (sales minus refunds).

Performance, Revshare, and Profit-shares aren’t guarantees “per se”, but for all intents and purposes, they are. There is an implied guarantee whenever you enter into a revshare or performance partnership: if you don’t make money, you don't have to pay me. In my opinion, this is one of, if not THE most desirable setup. First because it makes you accountable to your clients' results. Second it weeds out low performers. Perfect alignment between client and service provider fosters collaboration and a long-term relationship. I'm a big fan. The drawbacks are tracking and collection. So if you can find a way around that...you’ve hit a gold mine. This is a part of the offer we teach our agencies who use our software. We help them switch from a retainer model to a performance model and wrap that into the Grand Slam Offer I walked through earlier. I've seen countless agencies go from $20k/mo to $200k+/mo in a matter of a few months.

Healthy relationships are a constant give and take—a kind of cooperative dance. However, unhealthy relationships can disguise themselves as passion, drama, and even a state of balance. It’s only with the right vocabulary and mental tools that we can escape the illusion and see the truth: that we’re being used to feed our partner’s ego.

There is no one more sensitive or quick to injure than a true narcissist. It makes sense once you see their confidence and self-assuredness as it is: a thin veneer draped over constant self-doubt. It’s so thin that any level of criticism or attempt to stand up to them is instantly met with rage. They can lash out in a nanosecond, and their aim is precise.

The reason narcissists work so hard for special treatment—for pedestals to stand on and adoring fans—is their insecurity. They can’t stand themselves without all of those props and an audience ready to jump to their feet in a standing ovation. A narcissist alone is a person in deep self-hate and true sadness.

Narcissists rarely consider the long-term consequences of their actions, particularly when they have to do with others’ emotions. If your date ends with you in tears, the narcissist won’t give it too much thought. The important thing is that they’re right and left feeling good about themselves. If you can’t control your emotions, well, that’s not their problem.

No narcissist wants to develop their introspection. That’s a terrifying notion to most of them because one look inside will show them how much fear they carry inside. They’re not a swaggering, good-looking superstar; they’re a trembling child desperate to be loved. One glance might be all that true self needs to come out.

A narcissist works hard to make sure anyone close to them doesn’t have their own interests or identity. If that happens, those people might forget to work on making them comfortable, giving them attention, and making them feel valued. Any sign that a partner or close friend has other things to do besides shower the narcissist with their attention and energy is dangerous and has to be shut down immediately.

Narcissists also keep us in check by making sure we never quite meet their standards. Every attempt we make is picked apart and held up as proof that we don’t really love our partner or value our friend. No, nothing is good enough, and the narcissist will make sure you know that at every opportunity.

This move is called triangulation. Jan’s claim that I was “depressed”, and she was “worried” about me were meant to make me worry that perhaps I wasn’t feeling quite right. Narcissists love making their partners or family members question their own sanity. It puts the narcissist right in the driver’s seat and makes them look like a saint for being concerned in the first place.

Someone who gaslights another person, such as a child, partner, or family member, wants to make that person question their sanity, memories, or perception of reality. Like Gregory playing with the lights or making objects disappear, it’s a ploy to make a person feel powerless in the world and their relationship. A successful attempt at gaslighting ends with one person telling the other what’s real, what their opinion should be, and what they remember. Let someone gaslight you long enough, and you’ll atrophy into a kind of zombie bumping around in the world.

Other bad habits that can allow a gaslighter into your life include taking on too much or refusing to say no to someone who needs help, even if you have no time. The second action is a symptom of people-pleasing. It’s a nice habit on the surface, but it’s a rose-tinted view of a lack of self-respect. If you value yourself as a person, you value your time and self-care. When others see that you put yourself last, they’ll follow your example. Please don’t misunderstand me—I am not blaming victims in any way. Rather, I want to alert you that some of your bad habits could attract toxic people. I want you to take care of yourself and keep yourself safe however you can.

Discrediting You to Others I believe to discredit the same person you claim to love is the lowest move out there. A narcissist sees this incredibly underhanded play and thinks, “I can do that.” This is a long con. Your narcissist partner or relative will feign concern for you while dropping hints that you are “unstable” or calling you “crazy” to anyone in your personal network. This works as a defense in case you go to anyone for help.

This is love-bombing, or the Idealization Stage. This stage helps narcissists draw in someone who is unsure of themselves. A confident partner won’t need this much attention from someone new and might find it stifling. However, someone who’s recently been hurt, has low self-esteem, or feels desperate for a partner will swoon at this kind of attention. Many people I’ve spoken to describe this stage as “a dream.” That tells me a lot. One piece of advice I can give is when something feels too good to be true, that’s because it probably is.

Remember, a gaslighter needs someone to tell them that they’re worthwhile, and that takes grooming. Someone targeted by a narcissistic gaslighter requires time and effort to shape into the kind of partner they want. They need to woo their new partner with romance, promises, and declarations of love, but they also want this new partner to doubt themselves at every turn. That way, the narcissist is the source of knowledge, confidence, and even fun in the relationship.

First, always remember what drives a narcissist’s behavior. Everything behind a narcissist’s actions comes from a place of fear. They’re afraid they’ll be uncovered as a fraud, be alone, don’t deserve love, and everyone else is better than them. They’ve learned to fight that fear by constantly making others feel terrible, but this sham of a life can’t last forever, and they can see the end coming. Eventually, people around the narcissist—even those who love them dearly—start to see through the cracks. The truly adept gaslighters who can toy with emotions better than anyone else might hide longer, but even they get outed as fake and awful.

Don’t loan out your card or make your passwords too obvious. Narcissists don’t hesitate to spend a significant other’s money. Keep your accounts secure so you can always have a way to fund what you need and pay for what you want.

Stand on what you know to be true. When your gaslighter sounds confident, that doesn’t mean they’re automatically right; it means they are certain they can manipulate you and make you feel weak. Hold onto your personal truth and remember that you never have to defend your emotions; your strength will see you through.

Keep reminding yourself that staying means disrupting your life. It means committing to a toxic person, not a loving one. It also means you see yourself as someone who does not deserve happiness and love, but you do!

Of course, erasing the problem doesn’t fix anything. Exactly the opposite happens, actually; the victim gets a brief respite from the abuse, the narcissist gets to pretend they’re truly a good, caring person, and then slowly, both return to their former patterns. After a few days, the narcissist builds up the negative behavior piece by piece, and their victim slowly falls back into depression and a feeling of helplessness. The victim mentions leaving again, and out comes the hoover for another clean up.

Now, to maintain your boundaries, you need people who respect how you feel. If anyone dismisses how you feel or doesn’t listen to you when you express a clear distaste for what’s happening, that is someone undeserving of your time. If you get called names or accused of being “sensitive” when you stand up for what you want, consider that a stamp of approval for you to walk away.

You need to feel all of this to the deepest degree possible. Let the tears flow, splurge on some junk food, run whenever you feel up to it, and live in the euphoria for a moment. The loss of your former relationship is important, but so is the person you used to be before you met your narcissist. You’ll never be them again—you can’t be, you’ve come too far. The new you is beautiful and powerful, but the old you deserves a memorial.

But what we question the most is the relationship itself. If we’ve married a narcissist or moved in with one, we start to wonder if this love is truly what love should look and feel like. Should it be this rollercoaster ride of unpredictable emotion, or should it be a calm, canoe ride from one end of a lake to another?

We can consciously override any urge to push back in dominance and provide, instead, a prestigious response, by offering respect and acclaim for their efforts.

I’ve found its knowledge to be a comfort. This has come in a variety of contexts. For instance, I write to you in my forty-fifth year. Not too long ago, I’d sometimes feel self-conscious about my age and its various signs. I now realise these signs are symbols in a game I’m no longer required to play. Competing with the young in games of youth is not just hopeless, it’s dull. The trick is to find new and better games. There are different worlds to explore, in the second half of life, most more meaningful than those of the first.

I’m also more conscious of my thoughts, and their capacity to twist into self-serving stories. I catch myself ruminating hotly on events, automatically weaving a moral tale of heroes and villains around small humiliations and global headlines. There are always status battles at the core of these imaginings; they come when I feel threatened. By noticing this happening, I’m now better able to hinder the process, to step outside it and restore at least a modicum of rationality.

Suffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity to seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level. With craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied but lack ambition.

The human mind is like a sizzling-hot frying pan of associations—throw a handful of seeds in there and they’ll explode into new ideas like popcorn. Every note is the seed of an idea, reminding you of what you already know and already think about a topic. There is a powerful way to facilitate and speed up this process of rapid association: distill your notes down to their essence. Every idea has an “essence”: the heart and soul of what it is trying to communicate. It might take hundreds of pages and thousands of words to fully explain a complex insight, but there is always a way to convey the core message in just a sentence or two.

Instead of trying to find “the best” content, I recommend instead switching your focus to making things, which is far more satisfying.

Feynman’s approach encouraged him to follow his interests wherever they might lead. He posed questions and constantly scanned for solutions to long-standing problems in his reading, conversations, and everyday life. When he found one, he could make a connection that looked to others like a flash of unparalleled brilliance. Ask yourself, “What are the questions I’ve always been interested in?”

Take a moment now to write down some of your own favorite problems. Here are my recommendations to guide you: Ask people close to you what you were obsessed with as a child (often you’ll continue to be fascinated with the same things as an adult). Don’t worry about coming up with exactly twelve (the exact number doesn’t matter, but try to come up with at least a few). Don’t worry about getting the list perfect (this is just a first pass, and it will always be evolving). Phrase them as open-ended questions that could have multiple answers (in contrast to “yes/no” questions with only one answer).

The renowned information theorist Claude Shannon, whose discoveries paved the way for modern technology, had a simple definition for “information”: that which surprises you.7 If you’re not surprised, then you already knew it at some level, so why take note of it? Surprise is an excellent barometer for information that doesn’t fit neatly into our existing understanding, which means it has the potential to change how we think.

Perhaps the most immediate benefit of capturing content outside our heads is that we escape what I call the “reactivity loop”—the hamster wheel of urgency, outrage, and sensationalism that characterizes so much of the Internet.

Instead of confronting a terrifying blank page, I’m looking at a document filled with quotes: from letters, from primary sources, from scholarly papers, sometimes even my own notes. It’s a great technique for warding off the siren song of procrastination.

Now each chapter starts life as a kind of archipelago of inspiring quotes, which makes it seem far less daunting. All I have to do is build bridges between the islands.

The process of knowing yourself can seem mystical, but I see it as eminently practical. It starts with noticing what resonates with you. Noticing what seems to call out to you in the external world and gives you a sense of déjà vu. There is a universe of thoughts and ideas and emotions within you.

Many of us suspect that we, too, have become machine food. And, in a way, we have. As Richard Seymour writes in his blistering 2019 dissection of social media, The Twittering Machine, we think we are interacting—writing and singing and dancing and talking—with one another, “our friends, professional colleagues, celebrities, politicians, royals, terrorists, porn actors—anyone we like. We are not interacting with them, however, but with the machine. We write to it, and it passes on the message for us, after keeping a record of the data.”

Zadie Smith saw all this coming more than a decade ago. Writing about the rise of Facebook, and by extension all the other social media platforms, she observed, “When a human being becomes a set of data on a website like Facebook, he or she is reduced. Everything shrinks. Individual character. Friendships. Language. Sensibility. In a way it’s a transcendent experience: we lose our bodies, our messy feelings, our desires, our fears.”25 But we aren’t transcending to something higher, just less ourselves.

We carefully cultivate online personas—doubles of our “real” selves—that have just the right balance of sincerity and world-weariness. We hone ironic, detached voices that aren’t too promotional but do the work of promoting nonetheless. We go on social media to juice our numbers, while complaining about how much we hate the “hell sites.”

In our sprawling suburbs, talented teens and young adults, many from immigrant families, set up cameras in their bedrooms and wrote, goofed, sang, sewed, painted nails, and gamed their way past the cultural gatekeepers who a few years earlier would almost certainly have stood in their way. Some, like the Toronto comedian Lilly Singh, made it all the way from YouTube to global stardom. Others burned bright and then seemed to disappear, unable to cope with the algorithms’ ever-changing demands for fresh content or the abuse that came with such intense and continuous personal exposure. One thing was clear, however: noncelebrities (or not-yet-celebrities) without an advertising budget, and often without family connections, could indeed apply the principles of corporate branding to their intimate selves, and more than a few of them would win the personal branding lottery.

they have nonetheless grown up with an acute consciousness of having an externalized double—a digital double, an idealized identity that is partitioned from their “real” selves and that serves as a role they must perform for the benefit of others if they are to succeed. At the same time, they must project the unwanted and dangerous parts of themselves onto others (the unenlightened, the problematic, the deplorable, the “not me” that sharpens the borders of the “me”). This triad—of partitioning, performing, and projecting—is fast becoming a universal form of doppelganging, generating a figure who is not exactly us, but whom others nonetheless perceive as us.

The students I teach are troubled by where all of this doubling is leading. Nonetheless, almost all feel duty bound to participate in creating their own digital doubles on social media (as do I). One student shared that she had gotten off Instagram because the pressures to perform an idealized version of herself, and the inundations of images of others doing the same, were ravaging her mental health. But then came the 2020 Black Lives Matter uprisings. “My friends all told me I had to get back on Instagram and post pro-BLM,” she said, “or everyone would think I was racist”—this despite the fact that she had been participating in all the protests in her area, albeit in a quiet, behind-the-scenes way. She logged back on and posted, but reluctantly; she knew there was something wrong with a culture that valued public performances of a virtuous self over more tangible solidarities and relationship building.

In his essay “Self-Reliance,” Ralph Waldo Emerson famously wrote, “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds”;27 in the same passage, he worried that individuals were getting stuck in “a reverence for our past act or word because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.” Data. Computing. That was written in 1841, but it sounds very much like the cri de coeur of many a modern YouTuber or Twitch streamer, stuck churning out near-identical videos almost daily, lest fickle subscribers abandon them for one of the legions of new copycat influencers whom the algorithm recommends in the column next to or underneath their own videos.

In her landmark 1984 book, Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center, hooks cautioned readers to “avoid using the phrase ‘I am a feminist’”6 and opt instead for “I advocate feminism,” explaining that unlike the “I am” label, which triggers the listener’s prior beliefs about what and who is a feminist, the latter is far more likely to begin a conversation about what concrete changes feminism is trying to achieve and “does not engage us in the either/or dualistic thinking that is the central ideological component of all systems of domination in Western society.”

The result is a troubling dynamic—one that sits at the heart of our doppelganger culture. Rather than being defined by consistently applied principles—about the right to a democratically controlled public square, say, and to trustworthy information and privacy—we have two warring political camps defining themselves in opposition to whatever the other is saying and doing at any given time. No, these camps are not morally equivalent, but the more people like Wolf and Bannon focus on very real fears of Big Tech—its power to unilaterally remove speech, to abscond with our data, to make digital doubles of us—the more liberals seem to shrug and sneer and treat the whole package of worries like crazy-people stuff. Once an issue is touched by “them,” it seems to become oddly untouchable by almost everyone else. And what mainstream liberals ignore and neglect, this emerging alliance lavishes with attention.

Importantly, the role of these progressives is not to renounce the goals of social justice and embrace a hard-right worldview (the journey made by well-known ex-Trotskyists like Irving Kristol in the mid-twentieth century). On the contrary, they must continue to identify as proud members of the left, or devoted liberals, while claiming that it is the movements and tendencies of which they were once part that have betrayed their own ideals, leaving these uniquely courageous individuals politically homeless and in search of new alliances.

Steve Bannon, regardless of whatever else he may be, is first and foremost a strategist. And he has a knack for identifying issues that are the natural territory of his opponents but that they have neglected or betrayed, leaving themselves vulnerable to having parts of their base wooed away. This is what he helped Trump do in 2016. He knew that a large sector of unionized blue-collar workers felt betrayed by corporate Democrats who had signed trade deals that accelerated factory closures in the 1990s, and that their anger deepened when the party bailed out banks instead of workers and homeowners after the 2008 crash. He paid close attention to the ways Occupy Wall Street was dismissed and then crushed, and to how Bernie Sanders, whose left-populist 2016 presidential campaign grew out of that movement, faced all kinds of dirty tricks from the Democratic Party establishment as it closed ranks around Hillary Clinton. Bannon saw an opportunity to peel away a portion of the male unionized workforce that had always voted for Democrats—most of it white, but not all of it. Bannon crafted a campaign message out of the betrayals of his rivals: Trump would be a new kind of Republican, one who would stand up to Wall Street, shred corporate trade deals, close the border to supposedly job-stealing immigrants, and end foreign wars—moreover, unlike Republicans before, he pledged to protect social programs like Medicare and Social Security. This was the original MAGA promise. Of course, it was a bait and switch

Meloni denouncing a system in which everyone is reduced to being “perfect consumer slaves”14—only instead of offering an analysis of capital, a system that must enclose all aspects of life inside the market in order to mine them as new profit centers, she blames trans people, immigrants, secularists, internationalism, and the left for a hollowness at the core of modernity. And while she rails against the “big financial speculators,”15 she has no policies to rein them in, only attacks on Italy’s meager unemployment protections.

And there is something else that I have noticed while listening to Bannon—he sticks, fairly judiciously, to the issues where there is the most common ground: hating Biden, rejecting vaccines, bashing Big Tech, fearmongering about migrants, casting doubt on election results. He skates lightly over more traditionally conservative issues that he may care about but that are likely to alienate some of his newfound friends, including abortion and gun rights. He doesn’t ignore them, but they don’t take up nearly as much airtime as one might expect. This, once again, is the opposite of what happens on large parts of the left. When we have differences, we tend to focus on them obsessively, finding as many opportunities as possible to break apart. Important disagreements need to be hashed out, and many conflicts that arise in progressive spaces are over behaviors that, when unchallenged, make those spaces unwelcoming or dangerous for the people they target. But it’s not a great secret that plenty of people routinely go too far, turning minor language infractions into major crimes, while adopting a discourse that is so complex and jargon-laden that people outside university settings often find it off-putting—or straight-up absurd. (“Speak in the vernacular,”17 the radical historian Mike Davis once pleaded with young organizers. “The moral urgency of change acquires its greatest grandeur when expressed in shared language.”) Moreover, when entire categories of people are reduced to their race and gender, and labeled “privileged,” there is little room to confront the myriad ways that working-class white men and women are abused under our predatory capitalist order, with left-wing movements losing many opportunities for alliances that would make us stronger and more powerful. All of this is highly unstrategic, because whichever groups and individuals we kick to the curb, the Mirror World is there, waiting to catch them, praise their courage, and offer a sympathetic ear.

Similar attempts at diversifying the hard-right base can be seen in Australia and France. These movements are still built around hate and division—on scapegoating migrants; on pathologizing trans youth; on bashing teachers trying to support these students or tell a truer story of their nations’ past; and on scaremongering about communists and Islamists. “Inclusive nationalism” just means that they have found some new blocs of voters who are also looking for scapegoats, and not all of them are white, or male.

Inevitably, people reach for narratives to make sense of this reality. Among such narratives is the one that the climate justice movement has been telling for years—the same one Avi was running on: people of good conscience, across all the lines meant to divide us, can band together, build power, and transform our societies into something fairer and greener, just in the nick of time. But that story is getting harder to believe with each day that goes by. So, another narrative, this one spreading much faster, goes like this: I’ll be okay, I’m prepared, with my canned goods and solar panels and relative place of privilege on this planet—it’s other people who will suffer. The trouble with that narrative, though, is that it requires finding ways to live with and rationalize the mass suffering of others. And that’s where the stories and logics that cast other people’s deaths as an unavoidable form of natural selection, perhaps even a blessing, come into play.

the members of these subcultures who made the Disinformation Dozen list had all figured out how to monetize the far-out—they have some of the largest online platforms and the strongest personal brands, which they use to sell high-priced retreats and seminars and memberships and newsletters and tinctures. These are big-name influencers with countless smaller-time followers. Once this is understood, the new alliances start to make more sense. Small businesses and freelancers who work with or on bodies were among the hardest hit by pandemic lockdowns. Some of the reasons for that made epidemiological sense: therapeutic work didn’t allow for social distancing, and exercise studios necessarily involve heavy breathing in enclosed spaces. But there were also ways that this sector got a particularly raw deal. Early Covid relief programs were heavily biased toward larger workplaces with many staff employees; small owner-operated fitness studios where most workers are on contract often fell through the cracks of government aid, even as they were still on the hook for massive urban rents. Many gym owners took on large personal debts to keep operating under stringent new rules, only for the rules to continually change in often arbitrary ways as the pandemic wore on. Where I live in Canada, for instance, gyms were shut down in response to the 2022 Omicron surge, but, as many fitness enthusiasts pointed out (with more than a little judgment) fast-food restaurants and strip clubs seemed to be just fine. Meanwhile, small fitness studios seemed to face many more restrictions than giant sports stadiums and ski resorts, which could afford to pay lobbyists to protect their interests. The net effect was an economic slaughter

With dreams of justice dashed, along with collective visions for a good life, it was everyone for themselves—a world of atomized individuals climbing over one another to get an edge in newly deregulated, precarious job markets. It was in this context, she argued, that so many turned their attention toward perfecting the body, with treadmills replacing protest marches and free weights replacing free love. The pressures were far greater for women at the start, but soon enough even heterosexual cis men would face their own unattainable fitness and beauty standards and myths. For Ehrenreich, this was all “part of a larger withdrawal into individual concerns after the briefly thrilling communal uplift some had experienced in the 1960s … If you could not change the world or even chart your own career, you could still control your own body—what goes into it and how muscular energy is expended

As the climate crisis accelerates, with the land heaving beneath us and burning around us, I expect that many of us will continue to find comfort in whatever small bodily obeyances we can muster. There is solace to be found there. Yet I also know, from personal experience as a teenage bulimic and Jane Fonda’s Workout addict, that this quest, in its extreme and unhealthy forms, is itself a kind of doubling. For the person dedicating themselves to transformation through diet and fitness, there is you as you are now, and—ever present—there is you as you imagine you could be, with enough self-denial and self-discipline, enough hunger and enough reps. A better, different you, always just out of reach. Ehrenreich wrote evocatively of the strange silence of gyms, a place where people gather together in close quarters but barely speak to one another except to negotiate access to machines. This, she observed, is because the primary relationship at play is not between separate people working out, but between the person working out and themselves as they wish to be, their body double.

While recognizing the real failures of her profession, she argues that these influencers are exploiting “medicine’s sexism to create a new and gendered market for snake oil”18—instead of trying to fix the system, they profit from its abandonments. “The wellness industry isn’t pushing for more and better science into women’s health—it wants instead to create a secondary pathway for women’s issues outside of the mainstream. The subtler risk is that wellness will continue to evolve along a gendered path, disproportionately exposing women to the harms of quackery.”

In the alternative-health world, everyone is selling something: classes, retreats, sound baths, essential oils, anti-metal-toxin sprays, Himalayan salt rock lamps, coffee enemas. Supplements alone were worth an estimated $155 billion20 worldwide in 2022. It’s much the same on Bannon’s War Room or Alex Jones’s Infowars, with their manly supplements, survivalist supplies, Freedom Fests, precious metal offers, colloidal silver toothpaste, and weapons training—and let us not forget Tucker Carlson’s 2022 documentary in which he recommended that men regularly tan their testicles with a special infrared light in order to increase testosterone levels in preparation for the “hard times” ahead. The voices of these two kinds of pitches are distinct—one intimate, the other gruff and bullying. (Jones, as his legal woes have worsened, has resorted to pushing his branded products by screaming at his audience, “If you don’t support us, you’re helping the enemy.”)21 But the underlying message is quite similar: society is crashing, and you as an individual (not a member of a society) need to prepare and toughen up, whether by optimizing your body, stocking your disaster bunker, or both. In many ways, the most successful influencers in the wellness and fitness worlds—the people who make fortunes from selling idealized versions of themselves and the idea that you, too, can attain nirvana through a project of perpetual self-improvement—are a perfect fit with far-right economic libertarians and anarcho-capitalists, who also fetishize the individual as the only relevant social actor. In neither worldview is there any mention of collective solutions or structural changes that would make a healthy life possible for all.

The core Covid-era public health message—that we all needed to undergo some individual inconveniences for the sake of our collective health—enjoyed majority support. Yet it simply could not be reconciled with the wellness industry’s own overarching message: that individuals must take charge over their own bodies as their primary sites of influence, control, and competitive edge. And that those who don’t exercise that control deserve what they get. Neoliberalism of the body, in distilled form.

More to the point, vaccination programs that ask strong, healthy people to accept small inconveniences to protect themselves—as well as people who are sicker, older, and more medically vulnerable—are the precise opposite of biofascism.

At the risk of causing more confusion by sounding like my doppelganger, this is fascist thought. More specifically, it is genocidal thought. It recalls the ways in which colonial massacres were rationalized because, within the ranking of human life created by pseudoscientific racists, Indigenous peoples, such as the original residents of Tasmania, were cast as “living fossils.” Lord Salisbury, the UK prime minister, explained in an 1898 address that “you may roughly divide the nations of the world as the living and the dying.”32 Indigenous peoples were, in this telling, the pre-dead, with extermination merely serving to accelerate the inevitable timeline.

These are the histories currently being conjured up in mainstream wellness culture, which has adopted Silicon Valley’s notion of self-optimization, itself a by-product of the personal-branding culture that torments so many young people today. Every step counted. Every sleep measured. Every meal “clean.” And it is this context that has prepared the ground for a redux of the 1930s fascist/New Age alliance. The very idea that humans can and should be “optimized” lends itself to a fascistic worldview—because if your food is extra-clean, it can easily mean other people’s food is extra-dirty. If you are safe because your immune system is strong, it can flip to mean others are unsafe because they are weak. If you are optimized, others are, by definition, suboptimal. Defective. Next door to disposable. This is also the context in which some prominent anti-vaxxers have taken to calling themselves “purebloods,” since their blood is supposedly untainted by the jabs, never mind the term’s chilling supremacist overtones.

Such is the power of what doctors refer to as the “vaccine-autism myth”—the viral narrative that insists that childhood immunizations for measles, mumps, and rubella, which children start getting after their first birthday, is the cause of autism. It’s a narrative that would, in many ways, lay the foundation for what would become the anti–Covid vaccine movement. The earlier claims rely on an entirely discredited paper suggesting that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine may be associated with autism (and bowel disease), published in the prestigious British scientific journal The Lancet in 1998. Twelve years later, it was retracted by its publisher, who described the claims as “proven to be false.”2 Ten of the paper’s thirteen original coauthors had issued a note of retraction years earlier, in 2004, based on faulty “interpretation”3 of the study’s data. The main author, the gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield, was banned from practicing medicine in Britain in light of undisclosed conflicts of interest and what Britain’s General Medical Council described as his “callous disregard”4 for the children in his study. Yet almost a quarter century after Wakefield’s paper first appeared, and with no further evidence supporting the claim, the myth is more prevalent than ever. It continues to be spread by a global network of Facebook groups, YouTube channels, and slickly produced documentaries that do a fair job, for those untrained in reading scientific papers, of impersonating investigative journalism. The network has its own medical pseudo-experts, celebrities, influencers, and lawyers, most prominently Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Their debunked claims have contributed to a resurgence of diseases including measles,5 which in 2000 was declared eliminated in the United States but has since returned with a vengeance.

Procreation has long been viewed, particularly by those who come from wealth, as a form of temporal doubling, with the child sometimes given the same name as the father or mother, extending the parent’s legacy and fortune into the future (e.g., RFK Jr.). In our time of personal branding and optimized selves, you don’t need inherited wealth or a title to do something similar. You can simply treat your child as a spin-off or brand extension—you and your little mini-me can dress up in matching outfits for Instagram or share adorable dances on TikTok.

So many of the battles waged in the Mirror World—the “anti-woke” laws, the “don’t say gay” bills, the blanket bans on gender-affirming medical care, the school board wars over vaccines and masks—come down to the same question: What are children for? Are they their own people, and our job, as parents, is to support and protect them as they find their paths? Or are they our appendages, our extensions, our spin-offs, our doubles, to shape and mold and ultimately benefit from?

never was one of those people with a fixed image in my head of who I would be as a parent and who my children would be to me; it just wasn’t a feature of my fantasy life. That probably made me a less instinctual parent, but it also may have made me more genuinely curious to meet whoever showed up. I say this because I have noticed, in my conversations with parents of autistic children, that they often undergo an intense grieving period as they mourn the fantasies that had taken deep root in their hearts. So sad are they about the child-double who wasn’t that they can’t really see the singular child who is. It’s not unlike what some parents of trans kids go through: they often need a little time to grieve the daughter or son they thought they had before they can fully accept their child’s gender identity.

From the researcher’s perspective, the differences between the genres should be glaring. Responsible investigators follow a set of shared standards: double- and triple-source, verify leaked documents, cite peer-reviewed studies, come clean about uncertainties, share sections of text with recognized experts to make sure technical terms and research methods are correctly understood, have fact-checkers comb through it all prepublication, then hand it all over to a libel lawyer (or in the case of my books, multiple lawyers in different territories). It’s a slow, expensive, careful process, but it gets us as close as we know how to something we all used to agree was proof that something was true. Conspiracy influencers perform what I have come to think of as a doppelganger of investigative journalism, imitating many of its stylistic conventions while hopping over its accuracy guardrails.

The end result of being surrounded by this kind of discourse is a reflexive state of continuous disbelief that the Brazilian professor of philosophy Rodrigo Nunes calls “denialism.” This in an upside-down state that, like everything else in the Mirror World, neatly serves the right and undercuts the left because, Nunes writes, it “displaces the real threats looming on the horizon into distorted, fun-house versions of themselves. Thus, the problem with democracy is not political elites everywhere who are beholden to the interests of corporations and financial markets, but a secret cabal of pedophiles planning to institute a world government.”

Jack Bratich, a Rutgers University communications scholar with a focus on conspiracies, explained this possible trajectory to me like this: “Liberal investments in individualism result in thinking of power as residing in individuals and groups rather than structures. Without an analysis of capital or class they end up defaulting to the stories the West tells itself about the power of the individual to change the world. But hero narratives easily flip into villain narratives.”10 This is a crucial point: conspiracy culture does not challenge the hyper-individualism that is at the heart of so many crises reaching their breaking points. Instead, it mirrors it, putting all the blame for society’s ills on singularly powerful individuals: Fauci. Gates. Schwab. Soros.

In the neoliberal era that began in the 1970s and has not yet ended, every hardship and every difficulty—from poverty to student debt to home eviction to drug addiction—has been pathologized as a personal failing. Every success, meanwhile, is lauded as proof of the relative superiority of the supposedly self-made. And, of course, these delusions of rugged individualism go far deeper than the half century of neoliberal unmaking. We who live in settler colonial states like the United States, Canada, and Australia have, for the most part, never truly reckoned with the fact that our nations exist only because of the twin thefts of stolen land and stolen people, that slavery and genocide were the bloody subsidies that allowed colonists, many of whom were themselves in debt peonage, to engage in their self-making adventures. And neither have the European nations that launched those colonial crusades in the first place.

conspiracy theorists get the facts wrong but often get the feelings right—the feeling of living in a world with Shadow Lands, the feeling that every human misery is someone else’s profit, the feeling of being exhausted by predation and extraction, the feeling that important truths are being hidden. The word for the system driving those feelings starts with c, but if no one ever taught you how capitalism works, and instead told you it was all about freedom and sunshine and Big Macs and playing by the rules to get the life you deserve, then it’s easy to see how you might confuse it with another c-word: conspiracy.

For Jesse Wente, a prominent Ojibwe writer and chair of the Canada Council for the Arts, the mirroring was glaring. It’s “not a coincidence this occurs as more truths of history are revealed,”42 Wente wrote about the convoy, which he described as “a desire to reassert colonial dominance in the face of actually having to face [those truths] and to provide a sense of community where the pandemic has shown there is little.”

For this new political configuration, convincing people of their unproven theories was never the real point—it was only ever a tool. The point, consciously or not, is to foster denial and avoidance. The point is not to have to do hard and uncomfortable things in the face of hard and uncomfortable realities, whether Covid, or climate change, or the fact that our nations were forged in genocide and have never engaged in a remotely serious process of making repair. Denial is so much easier than looking inward, or backward, or forward; so much easier than change. But denial needs narratives, cover stories, and that is what conspiracy culture is providing.

All members of historically hated groups lug around versions of this invisible double, and some doublings are far more dangerous than others. To be Black in the United States, W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in 1897, required a “double-consciousness,”6 a constant feeling of “two-ness,” which generated a longing “to merge his double self into a better and truer self,” one that did not require this partition. To this day, Blackness generates a double that is so treacherous to those it is projected upon, and so unremitting in its persistence through the centuries, that no activity is safe from being overtaken by the lethal racial double—not driving, not going for a run, not walking home from the store, not struggling with the lock on your own jammed front door. (“I plan to give you reasons for your jumpy fits / and facial tics,”7 wrote June Jordan in her 1976 poem “I Must Become a Menace to My Enemies.”)

QAnon stands out not for the originality of its plotlines, but for its ability to mash up the more modern trope of a Jewish cabal running the world with the more ancient blood libel involving kidnapped and drained Christian children. In QAnon’s version, an international conspiracy that includes many prominent Jews, but is not restricted to Jews, kidnaps children to drain them of adrenochrome, apparently in the hopes of prolonging the conspirators’ own lives. These stories are currently coursing and combining and morphing in our culture, lending an ancient and sinister energy to the invisible ethnic double that we Jews lug around.

In the Mirror World, conspiracy theories detract attention from the billionaires who fund the networks of misinformation and away from the economic policies—deregulation, privatization, austerity—that have stratified wealth so cataclysmically in the neoliberal era. They rile up anger about the Davos elites, at Big Tech and Big Pharma—but the rage never seems to reach those targets. Instead it gets diverted into culture wars about anti-racist education, all-gender bathrooms, and Great Replacement panic directed at Black people, nonwhite immigrants, and Jews. Meanwhile, the billionaires who bankroll the whole charade are safe in the knowledge that the fury coursing through our culture isn’t coming for them. Neither Steve Bannon nor Tucker Carlson invented this play. Over the centuries, anti-Jewish conspiracy has played a very specific purpose for elite power: it acts as a buffer, a shock absorber. Before popular rage could reach the kings, queens, tsars, and old landed money, the conspiracies absorbed it, directing anger to the middle managers—to the court Jew, to the scheming Jew, possibly with horns hidden under his skullcap. To Shylock. This is why anti-Semitism is sometimes referred to as “the socialism of fools,”9 a phrase coined by the Austrian democrat Ferdinand Kronawetter and popularized by Social Democrats in Germany in the 1890s. Where a socialist analysis, grounded in material realities, explains that capitalism is a system guided by internal logics that require dispossession and exploitation, peddlers of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories offer juicy tales of satanic evildoers acting outside the normal boundaries of societies and economies. And if they exist outside these structures, then they can simply be excised from the body politic—run out of town or, per Lindqvist and Peck, exterminated like brutes.

He describes how Hitler harnessed the economic suffering of the lower and middle classes—impoverished by the First World War, pounded by the sanctions afterward, then hit with the Great Depression—and directed that discontent at a chimera the Nazis called “Jewish capitalism.”23 Cast as distinct from the rest of supposedly healthy and decent capitalism, Jewish capitalism was a mythic structure, a bogeyman, with a familiar purpose: “Big business,”24 Leon wrote, “endeavored to divert and control the anti-capitalist hatred of the masses for its own exclusive profit.” Very much as the internationally networked Bannonite right rages at “globalists” to divert popular rage away from capitalism as a system and toward an imaginary cabal that can be cut out, leaving the structures that created and protect the global billionaire class intact.

Of course Palestinians would resist such ethnic cleaning with violence of their own. Yet rather than seeing Arab resistance for what it was—a nationalist, anti-colonial battle over land and self-determination (with some anti-Semitic elements, to be sure)—many influential Zionist leaders portrayed the entire Palestinian cause as nothing but more irrational Jew-hatred, a seamless continuation of the very same anti-Semitism that had resulted in the Holocaust, and that therefore needed to be crushed with the kind of militarized force that Jews had not been able to marshal in Nazi-controlled Europe. Within this imaginary, the Palestinian, as the Jew’s new eternal enemy, was treated as so illegitimate, so irrational, so other, that Israelis believed themselves to be justified in reenacting many of the forms of violence, dehumanizing propaganda, and forced displacement that had targeted and uprooted the Jewish people throughout Europe for centuries, a process that continues to this day with ongoing home demolitions, Israeli settlement expansions, targeted assassinations, settler rampages through Palestinian communities, openly discriminatory laws, and walled ghettos into which Palestinians are corralled.

As for those not directly affected by this struggle, it would help if more conversations could hold greater complexity—the ability to acknowledge that the Israelis who came to Palestine in the 1940s were survivors of genocide, desperate refugees, many of whom had no other options, and that they were settler colonists who participated in the ethnic cleansing of another people. That they were victims of white supremacy in Europe being passed the mantle of whiteness in Palestine. That Israelis are nationalists in their own right and that their country has long been enlisted by the United States to act as a kind of subcontracted military base in the region. All of this is true all at once. Contradictions like these don’t fit comfortably within the usual binaries of anti-imperialism (colonizer/colonized) or the binaries of identity politics (white/racialized)—but if Israel-Palestine teaches us anything, it might be that binary thinking will never get us beyond partitioned selves, or partitioned nations.

These doubles share one thing in common: all are ways of not seeing. Not seeing ourselves clearly (because we are so busy performing an idealized version of ourselves), not seeing one another clearly (because we are so busy projecting what we cannot bear to see about ourselves onto others), and not seeing the world and the connections among us clearly (because we have partitioned ourselves and blocked our vision). I think this, more than anything else, explains the uncanny feeling of our moment in history—with all of its mirrorings, synthetic selves, and manufactured realities. At bottom, it comes down to who and what we cannot bear to see—in our past, in our present, and in the future racing toward us. Performing and partitioning and projecting are the individual steps that make up the dance of avoidance. What is being avoided? I think it’s our true doppelganger. What Daisy Hildyard calls our “second body,”4 the one enmeshed with wars and whales, the one benefiting from the genocides of the past and adding our little drops of poison to the great die-offs of the future. The second body that perpetually mines the Shadow Lands for its comforts and conveniences.

The shift to confronting and reimagining structures requires something else: a recognition that this work is not something we can do on our own, as individuals, with a charity donation or an equity and diversity training, or a performance of virtue on social media. Indeed, a central reason why so many of us cannot bear to look at the Shadow Lands is that we live in a culture that tells us to fix massive crises on our own, through self improvement. Support labor rights by ordering from a different store. End racism by battling your personal white fragility—or by representing your marginalized identity group in elite spaces. Solve climate change with an electric car. Transcend your ego with a meditation app. Some of it will help—a bit. But the truth is that nothing of much consequence in the face of our rigged systems can be accomplished on our own—whether by our own small selves or even by our own identity groups.

This is the power of collective organizing: it expands the sense of the possible by expanding the possible “we.” It persuades participants that, contrary to what they have been told, their pain is not the result of a failure of character or insufficient hard work. Rather, it is the consequence of economic and social systems precisely designed to produce cruel outcomes, systems that can be changed only if people drop the shame and unite toward a shared goal. When enough people start believing that, it is an awakening in the truest sense of the word—a new group identity is constructed in real time, one wider and more spacious than what existed before.

When I try to understand Other Naomi, I see something similar. She, too, is both that and this. As a young writer, she helped inspire countless women to become feminists. In middle age, she took stands that required real moral courage—as when she walked out of that synagogue or shared her platform with people being pounded by missiles. She has also, especially lately, done a great many things that are extremely harmful, and I think many of the reasons behind them are pretty uninteresting: a desire for attention, for ego gratification, for cash; perhaps a drive to prove that she was right and that every person who ever attacked her was wrong. But all of those baser impulses have been greatly exacerbated by a culture that places limitless value on attention and money, while creating information tools that seem designed to turn every person’s screwup into an opportunity for public shaming, mockery, abandonment, and humiliation on a scale previously unimaginable

What kind of system is most likely to light up the best parts of all of us—and sustain the fire beyond a protest, or a summer uprising, or a presidential campaign? “I believe the starting point for building a more caring society,”20 writes Sally Weintrobe, a psychoanalyst who specializes in the climate crisis, “is never forgetting that care and uncare are inherent parts of us all, and that each seeks expression and dominance over the other.” In other words, we (not just those evil others) are all in a perpetual struggle with our that-and-thisness. The trouble is, we live in a society that encourages and rewards the uncaring parts of ourselves, while making it hard to care for others outside our immediate family (and often within it) in any sustained way. So, Weintrobe, argues, if we want more people to make better choices—not to shop for useless stuff as a source of solace, not to spread disinformation for clicks and clout, not to see other people’s vulnerability and need as a threat to our own interests—we need better structures and systems.

Personally, and to no one’s surprise, I think the jury is in on capitalism: it lights up our most uncaring, competitive parts and is failing us on every front that matters. What we need are systems that light up our better selves, the parts of ourselves that want to look outward at a world in crisis and join the work of repair. Systems that make it easier, in ways big and small, for care to win the battle over uncare.

there is anything this journey has taught me, it’s that identity is not fixed. Not mine. Not Wolf’s. Not even the barrier between our two identities. It’s all fluid, shifting around and doubling constantly. Negotiating that doubling—between our younger selves and our older selves, between our public selves and our private selves, between our living selves and our dying selves—is a part of what it means to be human. A bigger part of being human, though, and certainly of living a good life, is not about how we make ourselves in those shifting sands of self. It’s about what we make together.

Orders were to be clear: logically arranged, short sentences, using universally understood expressions and railroad designations – 0700 for 7 a.m. and 1900 for 7 p.m. Orders were to be precise: subordinates were to be made acquainted with the intentions of their superior. Orders were to be complete – distinguishing the part that each unit was asked to perform. Orders were to be short. The rule was that they should never contain a single word by the omission of which their meaning would not be suddenly and completely affected.

Every organizational structure makes doing some things easy and doing other things difficult. If the structure makes doing some things so difficult that there is a conflict between structure and strategy, the structure will win. So if you are serious about the strategy, in the case of conflict you have to change the structure.

The issue comes down to people. They are both the problem and the answer. Nothing happens unless the key people involved in it want it to, and if the top team does not stand four-squarely behind the strategy, it is doomed. They may not say that they disagree, but if there is a conflict between the strategy and their real convictions, you may as well not start. Curiously, people’s convictions tend to correlate with their interests. Their interests are largely determined by the structure and the compensation system. Both, therefore, must be examined in order to identify and remove any conflicts.

The general environment is characterized by friction. Friction means that there will always be less information available than we would like, that identifying the essential information is difficult, and that understanding each other will require special effort.

That leaves us with some choices. Historian Martin van Creveld has delineated them with startling clarity: Confronted with a task, and having less information available than is needed to perform that task, an organisation may react in either of two ways. One is to increase its information-processing capacity, the other to design the organisation, and indeed the task itself, in such a way as to enable it to operate on the basis of less information. These approaches are exhaustive; no others are conceivable. A failure to adopt one or the other will automatically result in a drop in the level of performance.

Following van Creveld’s principle, we have to structure the tasks implied by the strategy and the units responsible for carrying out those tasks in such a way that the units can perform the tasks with the available level of information. The bottom line is that organizational structure should make doing the most important things easy.

If a major plank of what is implied by the strategic intent is split across more than one unit, think again. Those activities which most need to be coordinated should fall within unit boundaries.

‘Grief is a beast that swallows us whole. All we can do is suffer and endure it until we’re mercifully excreted out the back end. But it’s important to remind ourselves that whether it’s a bereavement or a break-up, we don’t get to grieve without first having loved. It’s the price we pay for our lives being blessed by something that mattered.

You have to ignore your doubts and risk failure. You have to try to achieve something that seemed unachievable. This is the best recipe for confidence. And confidence is how we start giving ourselves permission to take up more space in the world, to want more for ourselves, and to feel as though we deserve it.

‘When we don’t think we’re worth much, we find ways to make our world small. We don’t allow ourselves to hope, because we’ve already accepted failure. And this pattern of thinking often determines the outcome of our most important choices. But, Sam, I have to tell you that doubt and confidence are both acts of faith. They’re both predictions of our capabilities. We either tell ourselves that we can or that we can’t. And these beliefs are a self-fulfilling prophecy, because we validate our doubts by giving up just as much as we embolden ourselves by refusing to give in. The only way you can break this cycle is to be brave.

The problem for Trans people is not their identity but how that identity is recognised, believed and supported. As we now know, when young Trans people are loved and have agency in their lives the outcomes are incontrovertibly positive. The tragedy is that this has taken so long to be understood when the positive outcomes related to the same level of care and support for Cisgender children has been a no-brainer since the beginning of modern psychology. How we respect children matters. A mature society recognises the value of a child’s personal agency in achieving quality child growth outcomes.
